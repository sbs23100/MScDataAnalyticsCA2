| 1 society of chartered surveyors ireland opening statement to joint oireachtas committee on housing , local government & heritage on construction costs in housing ( land , design , labour & materials ) introduction the society of chartered surveyors ireland ( sc si ) welcomes the opportunity to share our insights on construction costs to the joint committee on housing , local government and heritage on construction costs and we thank the chairman and committee for the invitation . as the leading professional body for chartered surveying professionals working in the property , construction and land sectors across ireland , we undertake research on a wide range of economic , industry and practice -related issues in the public interest . chartered surveyor members of the scsi work across the built environment , in both the public and private sectors , providing advice to clients across the entire lifecycle of a build , from green field site through to design , mapping , budgets , project management , sales , lettings , and property management . as such surveyors are well placed to provide real- time independent evidence of increasing construction costs and the impact this is having on the sector including the consequences for housing delivery . the current housing crisis with demand outstripping supply is well documented . it is forecast that the population of ireland will grow by up to 600,000 in the next 10 years , which will place additional pressures on the market to produce a greater selection of housing unit types and sizes , not jus t for growing families , but also for those who wish to downsize to two - and one -bedroom apartments . a proportionate amount of private and publicly developed units is therefore required to ensure that our urban and regional centres are developed in a way that caters for all demographics and family sizes , with varying income levels , in a coordinated and inclusive manner . for our economy to remain in a healthy position , the housing delivery market should be in a sustainable and well -functioning state to ensure that there is sufficient accommodation for future needs . the delivery of new units to the market has been playing catch- up since as far back as 2014/15 , when the scsi flagged to policymakers that the supply of housing to cater for demand was well below what was needed . this has been exacerbated by the lower than anticipated new housing output , compounded by the impact of brexit and covid over the last couple of years . the tragic conflict in ukraine at present and the impact that this is having on energy co sts is contributing to rises in material prices – all of which is pushing many planned developments out of viability . the scsi supports the ambitions of ‘ housing for all ’ strategy and the many initiatives of government aimed at increasing housing supply i ncluding the recent measures to mitigate the high levels of inflation absorbed by the construction sector for public works – inflation cooperation agreement . however , our research has identified significant cost inflation across the sector that if not tack led with a sense of urgency , will result in the ambitious housing delivery targets of ‘ housing for all ’ not page | 2 being met . the increased construction costs are not limited to urban centres , but are evident across the country in every region . it is the long -standing view of the scsi to tackle rising costs of construction , including the most recent material and labour hyperinflation , every facet of the input costs of residential development needs to be reduced . while several initiatives already underway to addr ess some of the blockages to housing delivery are to be commended , such as planning reform , these are longer - term and what is required now is urgent action to address construction cost inflation . mitigating measures to tackle the high costs of housing del ivery will require a proactive and cohesive response from government . many interventions may be outside the control of government to address , however , there are many construction input costs that are under the direct remit of local and national government . there is no single solution to driving down costs , but the cumulative impact of reducing costs across multiple headings can make a positive overall difference in the delivery costs of housing . our submission and its recommendations which focus on short- , medium - and long -term solutions , builds on previous evidence -based scsi reports highlighting the critical construction costs areas which we hope will provide some helpful up- to-date insights on how construction inflation can be tackled to ensure the sector meets governments housing targets . construction costs to turn now to the specifics of construction cost i will draw on some recent scsi construction cost reports , the detail is in our main su bmission but to focus on some key stats ; the scsi real cost of new house delivery report 2020 reported an increase in inflation on average by 12 % between 2016 and 20209 , which doesn ’ t take account of more recent increased inflation pressures . our research found that the cost of delivering a new estate type home ( 3 bedroom semi - detached ) was €330k in 2016 which rose to €371k in 2020 . the scsi real cost of new apartment delivery reports published in 2017 and 2021 respectively showed that lower rise suburban apartment delivery costs rose from €155k to €177k in during this 4 year period . scsi monitors commercial constructio n inflation through our tender price index ( tpi ) , first established in 1998 . the tpi tracks commercial projects over €0.5 million and reports that national annual inflation is at 13 % - year to december 2021 . the report concluded that the main reasons for current price inflation are high price volatility across a range of building materials - particularly insulation , cement , plasterboard metals and fuel labour shortages and the extremely high demand for projects across all tiers as the industry continues to readjust in the wake of the covid crisis . in respect of the first half of 2022 , it ’ s clear russia ’ s invasion of ukraine is having an impact on the price of materials previously sourced from the region espec ially steel and base metals while it has also led to a dramatic increase in fuel and energy costs . the data from our report also highlights the other factors present in terms of inflation such as labour cost increases following the implementation of the sectoral employment order which came into effect on 1 february and it is expected that the tender price index will also see some impact of this in our next report due in june/july 2022 . page | 3 management of risk has now become a primary foc us for companies to ensure that construction competitions awarded are structured to protect against inflation pressures within the market . some contracting firms are no longer accepting previous contract risks due to material inflation and are either delay ing jobs or selecting jobs where the client is taking on the risk . this is particularly apparent in the private sector . our submission addresses each of the input costs of construction including hard and soft costs , planning and zoning , enabling works , an d other statutory costs , utility connections and charges , building regulation , labour costs , public procurement , modern methods of construction and provides specific detail on building material price inflation . drawing from the expertise of our surveyor members working across the construction , land and property industry , the impact of increasing construction costs is clear . the sector is functioning with huge uncertainty about the pipeline of construction projects as viability remains so challenged across t he country . the scsi has numerous anecdotal examples of housing projects being paused and in worst case scenarios being cancelled outright . if this situation persists , housing completions will not be near the numbers required to meet government 's targets a nd to house our growing population . we are at a pivotal point now where considered decisions must be made to take action in the short term in addition to those medium to long term initiatives which are already underway and are addressed in our submission i ncluding land , taxation and vacant properties . immediate priority must be given to addressing those construction cost inputs that are within the direct control of government . uti lities and local authorities have a significant impact on the speed and cost of housing delivery . as such , they should be appropriately resourced in terms of staffing and funding to assist them to meet targets and improve efficiency . the following key construction cost inputs should be considered ; • resource local authorities and utilities to facilitate faster processing times • pausing of increases by local authorities on contributions • early engagement of irish water to avoid costly delays and cost certainty required regarding connection fees . • reduction of esb conn ection and associated site work charges and earlier engagement with developments to improve visibility of costs and connection timelines . • allow local authorities approve alterations to specification of buildings that do not materially alter the planning permission but allow for use of more cost -effective building materials that may be available at the time given the material price volatility . • require standard compliance with fire regulations minimum and remove more onerous costly measures not prescribed by regulation . • improve public procurement processes to ensure barriers do not exist for smaller operators who will be needed in order to have sufficient capacity in the sector • review into charges and fees associated with other site enabling works such a s temporary road closure fees and licensing fees . the impact of these measures would be significant and coupled with the other supply initiatives could be the difference in ensuring the viability of projects , delivering vital housing in the public interest . i am happy to take any questions and provide further detail on these recommendations or any other aspects of our submission . thank you .\n","page society chartered

housing system needs to be placed on a long -term economically sustainable footing . thankfully , s upply - key to addressing ireland ’ s housing needs - is increasing and housing for all is having a real impact . more homes are being built and bought than in a generation . in 2022 we saw the most number of hom es delivered since 2008 ( up 45.2 % on 2021 ) and we ’ ve recently seen record completion and commencement figures for a first quarter since the current data series began . the government is making record state investment available for housing , with €4.5 billion committed in 2023 . to ensure we build on this kind of momentum into the longer term , i t is important that we deliver the right homes , in the right place s , at the right price . in some cases , a gap exists between the construction cost and the market price of housing . this gap is making the delivery of homes economically unviable in certain key areas . while government have introduced immediate initiatives to help bridge the viability gap and activate supply we do need a more long -term approach . costs associ ated with residential construction remain high . these need to be tackled to enable a functioning housing market , particularly for apartment construction . action 19.1 of housing for all update committed to conduct an analysis of each component of the cost o f construction of house and apartment development , informed by cost comparisons with comparable eu countries . th is study , is a shared construction sector group and government initiative , facilitated by the department of housing , local government and heritage . it supports actions to implement reductions in residential construction cost and increased standardisation . in residential development , actual construction costs account for a pproximately 50 % of total development costs . this study is focused on the actual construction costs only and acknowledges work already done , and further work to be done , in examining the other 50 % of development costs . this review of total development costs is identified as an action from the study . 2 the actions in the report complement a range of other initiatives in housing for all to help achieve economic sustainability including the development of modern methods of construction and the establishment of ‘ constructinnovate ’ the new construction technology centre hosted by uni versity of galway . the study also identifies proposed cost reduction actions related to the specification ( standardisation , typologies and finishes ) and scope of works ( fixtures and fittings , appliances etc . ) and size . a collaborative approach with indust ry to develop standardised approaches for housing design and construction to inform the design of policy initiatives , and be used as best practice by industry , is proposed to deliver the actions and to realise the cost reduction opportunities identified by the report . the findings and follow up actions from the residential construction cost study will inform future policy and initiatives to deliver quality and cost effective design approaches . the subsequent follow up actions have been prioritised within government . my depa rtment in collaboration with other government departments , and industry , will act on these opportunities . i wish to thank the construction sector group ’ s nominated steering group , comprising representatives of the society of chartered surv eyors of ireland , the royal institute of architects of ireland , the construction industry federation , the local government management agency , and the wide range of industry , local government and public sector participants in the study ’ s workshops for their time and expertise . i look forward to continuing collaboration with industry and government stakeholders throughout the development and implementation of these actions . by building on this report with its actions combined with the other initiatives in housing for all , government continues to work to place housing delivery on a long - term economically sustainable footing , helping to ensure affordable and high- quality housing for all . darragh o ’ brien td minister for housing , local government and heritage 3 glossary of abbreviations ber berlin bhm birmingham boqs bill of quantities ceec european council of construction

the cost of construction of house and apartment development , informed by cost comparisons with comparable eu countries . the study is a shared construction sector group ( csg ) and government initiative , facilitated by the department of h ousing , local government and h eritage ( dhlgh ) . the scope of the study is to analyse actual residential construction costs for housing , apartments and student accommodation . the study aims to sup port reduction in residential construction costs and increased standardisation . research by industry identifies that construction costs account for approximately 50 % of overall development costs . the csg nominated a steering group in march 2022 to provide oversight to the study , comprising representatives on the royal institute of architects of ireland ( riai ) , the society of chartered surveyors of ireland ( scsi ) , the local government management agency ( lgma ) and the construction industry federation ( cif ) . a representative of the csg chaired the steering group . following a public procurement process , a construction economics consultant , mitchell mcdermott , was appointed in j uly 2022 . the csg steering group and dhlgh selected four case- study projects as the basis for the exercise , representative of actual residential projects being delivered in ireland at the time . these are a 3- bed semi -detached ‘ scheme house ’ , a suburban apartment building , an urban apartment building and a purpose- built student accommodati on ( pbsa ) building . whilst findings from this study may be applied across tenures , the study does not analyse the difference across tenures e.g . build to rent , social housing . there are a number of related studies currently underway between the dhlgh and the housing agency , which will also assist in establishing a strategic direction across the private , social and affordable housing sectors . taken cumulatively with this study , these will form a more comprehensive roadmap . these related studies are described in the recommendations section . in line with the scope set out in housing or all , this study is focused on the construction costs . specifically , the study is focused on construction costs of the 10 direct building works and associated preliminaries only . soft costs are not within the scope of this study , but are being considered under other housing for all studies , including those referenced in the last section of the executive summary below . the study carries out a comparative study across four north european comparator countries - denmark ( dk ) , germany ( ger ) , netherlands ( nl ) and united kingdom ( uk ) and focuses on specific cities within each country – copenhagen ( cp h ) , berlin ( ber ) , utrecht ( utr ) an d birmingham ( bhm ) respectively . in ireland ( ire ) , dubli n ( dub ) is the nominated city for comparison . the study examines costs and differences in design and construction on each of the four case study projects , using the ‘ travelling box ’ methodology ( i.e . the same dwelling built to an irish specification coste d in selected locations ) . it also examines typical european housing types in the four comparator locations and associated cost ranges . a synthesis of the cost and design comparisons and cost modelling exercise and feedback from the workshops , are presented as a summary of findings which identify potenti al cost reduction opportunities and inform the recommendations and a set of actions to realise these opportunities . 1.2 general findings the general findings from the study are noted below by building type and other findings arising mainly from the stakeholder engagement during the study ( to maximise stakeholder engagement workshops were held at the end of the study ’ s first three stages ) . due to the similarities in the findings for case study # 2 ( suburban apartment ) and case study # 3 ( urban apartment ) , these are combined . these general findings are summarised at the end of each case study chapter and in the stakeholder engagement chapter . case study # 1 is based on a comparison between ire ( dub ) and the uk ( bhm ) only , for reasons explained in the case study chapter . case studies # 2 , # 3 and # 4 are based on a comparison between dub and the four comparator locations . 1.2.1 case study ( cs ) # 1 - scheme house • travelling box exercise found lower scheme house costs in bhm the ‘ travelling box ’ exercise found that construction costs using irish specifications on a cost -per-sqm rate for the same scheme house were approximately 15 % lower in bhm than in dub . 11 • cost ranges for actual scheme houses are lower in bhm lower construction costs were also evident in bhm for an actual scheme house when built using the typical specifications for bhm . the cost -per-sqm rate was 6- 10 % lower in bhm than dub and the cost -per-unit basis was 21- 29 % lower in bhm than dub . this is due to a number of factors set out below . • cost and design comparison found differences in size and specification in bhm cost comparison indicates that uk can achieve a lower construction cost due to local market conditions2 and labour costs . this applies to both the travelling box and actual scheme houses . design comparison indicates differences in scope , unit sizing and specification , which lead to a lower cost in bhm than dub for actual scheme houses . on scope , typically no ensuites or fitt ed wardrobes are included in the 3- bedroom semi -detached scheme house in bhm . on unit sizing , the benchmark sampling for this study indicates that houses being delivered in bhm3 are up to 15 % ( 93 sqm vs 110 sqm ) smaller than dub . • cost modelling found pote ntial cost reduction opportunities on unit sizing by adopting some of the design comparison findings , the modelled cost -per-unit is reconciled within 21 % of bhm average construction cost . opportunities on the scheme house are primarily linked to size . potential opportunities for cost reduction also exist in scope and specification to a lesser extent . 1.2.2 case studies ( cs ) # 2 & # 3 – suburban and urban apartments • ‘ travelling box ’ exercise found similar apartment construction costs in all locations the ‘ travelling box ’ exercise found that overall construction costs using irish specifications on a cost -per-sqm rate for the same apartment building are broadly 2 this refers to scale , supply and demand of goods and services , imported goods , population base , regulatory framework of the construction sector which is unique or local to a particular location . 3 this unit size comparison is in the private- for-sale market . 12 in line ( +/ - 4 % for cs # 2 and up to +9 % for cs # 3 ) with construction costs in the four european comparator locations . • cost ranges for actual apartment buildings are lower in cph , ber and utr . lower construction costs were evident in cph , ber and utr than dub ( and bhm ) for actual apartment buildings when built using the typical specifications for those locations on a cost -per-sqm rate ( up to 30 % differences identified ) . • cost and design comparison found differences in scope , size and specifications in cph , ber and utr on the design comparison , cost differences were identified related to differences in scope , unit sizing and specification . it is common in cph , ber and utr to sell or rent apartments with exposed concrete slab ( bare ceilings ) , no floor finish , no fitted wardrobes , no light fittings and sometimes minimal or no fit ted kitchen . in addition , it is common for apartments to have a single bathroom shared between two or three bedrooms and no ensuites . stakeholders providing feedback during the study ’ s stage 2 workshop noted that some of these scope and specification choic es are market driven , and some may require further assessment in relation to achieving technical performance requirements including sound , hygiene and fire . when typical construction practices in two locations are compared , it is difficult , and not always possible to quantify cost impacts of all differences in individual regulations , standards or norms . not all standards and regulations are prescriptive . for example , cph , ber and utr requirements for apartment sizes are more performance- based than prescriptive and a significant range of apartment sizes is evident in these locations . • cost modelling found potential cost reduction opportunities on scope and specification by modelling the items identified in the comparison findings on the case study projects ’ irish baseline unit cost , the cost-per-unit is reconciled to within 18 % of the lowest comparison which was cph . potential cost reduction opportunities on apartments are primarily linked to scope and standardisation . 13 increased use of standardisation in co nstruction systems and specification of components such as windows is evident in the cph , ber and utr for apartments . manufactured panel systems ( a type of modern methods of construction ( mmc ) ) are more common in cph , ber and utr than labour - intensive site- based activities ( such as block - or brick -laying ) . cph , ber and utr also deliver a higher proportion of apartments with associated efficiencies . stakeholders in stage 2 workshop noted that diversity in the design and appearance of housing can increase construction costs . diversity also makes it more challenging to increase standardisation , including materials selection . if the european approaches were adopted , it is estimated the construction cost of a two -bed apartment has the potential to be reduced by up to 14 % . this consists of 3 % savings by small reductions in specification , 6 % savings could be achieved by reducing scope ( e.g . omitting ensuite s and extent of finishes ) and standard scope could be deferred ( e.g . kitchen , joinery and flooring ) , saving a further 5 % . the scope deferral whilst still a cost would be borne by the end- user in line with their budget and timing . 1.2.3 case study ( cs ) # 4 – pbsa • travelling box exercise found higher pbsa costs in european locations the ‘ travelling box ’ exercise found that overall construction costs using irish specifications on a cost -per-sqm rate for the same pbsa building are higher ( up to 11 % ) in the four european comparator locations albeit with the costs distributed differently between the building elements . • cost ranges for actual pbsa buildings are lower in cph , ber and utr lower construction costs were evident in cph , ber and utr for actual pbsa buildings when built using the typical specifications for those locations on a cost - per-sqm rate ( 10 % to 32 % differences identified ) . • cost and design comparison found differences in scope , size and specification in cph , ber and utr on the design comparison , the study found that dub typically builds a different typology to cph , ber and utr . these european locations design and build more studio / 1- bedroom units as opposed to the 6 to 8 beds per cluster arrangement common in dub ( and bhm ) . 14 when typical construction practices in two locations are compared , it is difficult , and not always possible to quantify cost impacts of all differences in individual regulations , standards or norms . not all standards and regulations are prescriptive . increased use of standardisation in construction systems and specification of components such as windows is evident in pbsa in cph , ber and utr . manufactured panel systems ( a type of mmc ) are more common in cph , ber and utr than labour -intensive site- based activities ( such as block - or brick - laying ) . • cost modelling found potential cost reduction opportunities on scope and specification by adopting some of the findings and modelling them against the case study project , the cost-per-unit is reconciled to within 11 % of the lowest comparator location ( ber ) . the value of having a design standard for pbsa with typology options ( clusters , ensuites/ shared bathrooms , studios ) and applications ( on- campus/ off -campus ) was discussed at the stage 2 stakeholder workshop . there is currently no national design standard for pbsa . potential cost reduction opportunities for pbsa were identified as design standards and unit sizing , as well as scope and specification . 1.2.4 other findings • building services costs are higher in dub building services costs were found to be higher in dub than other locations across all dwelling types . amongst one of the main areas of difference , district heating , i.e . cph , as opposed to site- based heat generation , which is adopted in ireland . • other dwelling types required stakeholders at the stage 2 and stage 3 workshops noted the importance of considering other dwelling typologies to achieve a medium level of density , which may have potential c ost reduction opportunities . 15 • design standard for pbsa beneficial it was noted by stakeholders in the stage 2 workshop that further standardised guidance would be of benefit . national design guidance for student accommodation would inform design approaches . a range of design options for students would be preferable , incl . small studios and clustered bed- spaces , both with and without ensuites . shared rooms was also suggested as an option . • opportunity for standardisation potential benefits of increased standardisation were cited by stakeholders in the workshops . support is needed for more offsite construction systems and components , such as modern methods of construction ( mmc ) . it was noted that any guidance on standardisation of plans and/or components should be accompanied by performance and economic best practice guidance . • application of planning guidance feedback noted that the variation in the application of planning design requirements for the appearance of housing can increase costs . this also mak es it more challenging to increase standardisation , including materials selection . • further studies required areas for further studies which were raised included the areas of soft costs , cost impact of construction programme and cost impact of different for ms of contract . 1.3 recommendations the study sets out recommendations below based on the findings , and are followed by a set of actions to be implemented following this study . general 1 . take account of the general findings in development of future policy and incentivisation measures . refer to action 1 . 2. review standardisation of housing design and construction , to include the size ranges of houses specifically . standardisation of plans and/or components sho uld be indicative only and accompanied by performance and economic best practice guidance . this work should be coordinated with work ongoing by the housing agency on examination of innovation/efficiencies in design regarding affordable housing types , form and density , which includes a 16 review of case examples both nationally and in other eu member states ( concluding in q2 2023 ) ; refer to actions 2 . 3. review technical specifications relating to building elements , such as external walls , windows and building ser vices . continue to support the development of city-wide district heating in urban areas . refer to actions 2 and 6 . 4 . disseminate the findings of the study to ensure that the construction cost implications of decision -making at all stages in a project , including early design development and planning , are considered , taking account of observations made by stakeholders in the stage workshops . refer to action 3 . 5 . develop a design standard for pbsa , taking account of observations made by stakeholders in the stage w orkshops . refer to action 4 . research 1 . utilise cost information from this study and other studies to analyse overall development costs . this work should be coordinated with work ongoing in related areas having regard to other studies in this area . refer to action 7 . 2 . undertake a market research study on market expectation and cultural factors e.g . whether there is a market for apartments i n ireland ( for sale or rental ) without fitted kitchens and wardrobes , and/or one bathroom and no ensuite , and/or whether bare ceilings with electrical services visible would be considered acceptable to potential buyers / renters . consider undertaking a study on the technical aspects and market appetite , and raise awareness for the ‘ grey box ’ approach on apartments ( i.e . flooring , kitchens , integrated appliances , wardrobes , suspended ceilings provided by owner / tenant ) , including handover and compliance procedures . review certain standards around apartment fittings and finishes . 3 . undertake a similar cost study at regular intervals , utilising the methodology developed in this study , including new comparator locations and housing types to expand the data available and to track trends occurring internationally . 17 4 . undertake a study of the cost of the social and physical infrastructure that is needed to service new development and the resulting correlation between density and cost per unit . 5 . conduct a study on design innovation and cost efficiency for medium and high density housing typologies taking account of forthcoming sustainable and compact settlement guidance by planning division on settlement forms/density standards . 6 . support research into productivity in cons truction study , in conjunction with a selection of construction partner and technical experts . align with other existing/ongoing work in this area such as dete mmc data dashboard . 1.4 actions a number of actions are generated from the findings and recommen dations of this study . these are set out in table 1 below . a collaborative approach with industry to develop standardised approaches for housing design and construction which can inform the design of policy initiatives and be used as best practice by industry is proposed to realise the cost reduction

should have access to sustainable , good quality housing to purchase or rent at an affordable price , built to a high standard , and located close to essential services , offering a hi gh quality of life. ’ reducing construction cost s is a key part of supporting the delivery of ireland ’ s housing for all plan . reducing co nstruction costs is critical to increasing supply . these have risen considerably over recent years through a combi nation of the increased cost of regulatory c ompliance and general increases in labour and materials costs . the housing system needs to be placed on a long -term economically sustainable footing . alongside other measures , costs associated with residential construction , which remain high , need to be tackled to enable a functioning housing market , particularly for apartment construction . the government and relevant state agencies will advance methods to reduce residential construction costs , par ticularly the cost of apartment constr uction , by increasing the focus of existing and planned construction- related initiatives on the residential const ruction sector , and by ensuring a coordinated , whole- of-government approach to residential construction . this will in clude the introduction and full imple mentation of a pipeline of cost reduci ng innovations and productivity measures , in line with its established re mit to improve productivity and efficiency , and to control price inflation . housing for all ’ s action 19.1 supports wi der planning , environmental and social objectives , to deliver inclusive , sustainable , safe and low -impact communities . the twin national planning framework objectives of tackling climate change ( nso 8 transition to a low carbon and climate resilient societ y ) and delivering more compact growth ( nso 1 compact growth ) require action to ens ure that we see developments at scale in our cities , particularly close to publ ic transport nodes and existing infrastructure . there is therefore a strong public policy imper ative to develop hous ing in our cities . in addition , there is a growing demand for urban living , with people wanting to live close to work a nd urban amenities , but despite the policy 24 support and the evident demand , the supply of apartments for sale at a pr ice people can afford has not been forthcom ing . with the above challenges in mind , t his study compliment s work being carried out by dhlgh and others under housing for all on other development cost areas , such as site acquisition and land value , planning , and utilities . 2.2 study outline & aim the residential construction cost study seeks to support both the reduction in residential construction costs and increased standardisation . to identify potential cost reduction opportunities , costs applicable to c omparable eu economies are compared and reviewed through international benchmarking on a range of typical housing types . findings and potential cost reduction opportunities can be subsequently disseminated for consideration by relevant bodies and industry , and can then also be used as a reference for similar future construction cost studies . the study is a shared construction sector group ( csg ) and government initiative , facilitated by the department of housing , local government and heritage ( dhlgh ) and is set out under 19.1 of hfa 2022 update : ‘ conduct an analysis of each co mponent of cost of construction ( including cost of compliance ) of house and apartment development , in formed by cost comparisons with comparable eu locations . agree a set of foll ow-up actions to be implemented arising from the exercise . ’ the csg and government , facilitated by the dhlgh , have undertaken the study with mitchell mcdermott construction cost c onsultants . the csg nominated a steering group to provide oversight to the study , comprising representatives on the royal institute of architects of ireland ( riai ) , the society of chartered surveyors of ireland ( scsi ) , the local government management agenc y ( lgma ) and the construction industry federation ( cif ) . a representative of the csg chaired the steering group . engagement with industry , professional bodies and public sector representatives was key to the study . the study included three stakeholder work shops towards the end of each successive work stage , providing progress updates , capturing the views 25 of stakeholders and their input into the direction of the study . a record of these workshops is set out in chapter 8 and further details are in appendix h. the project working group comprised senior staff of mitchell mcdermott and project managers from dhlgh ’ s residential construction cost and innovation unit . 2.3 study objectives • to illustrate how smart residential design could deliver housing , planning , social and environmental policy objectives in a cost -efficient manner with a view to reducing cost , with a particular focus on higher -density development . • to review , by way of international benchmarking , how residential construction costs in ireland compare to comparable eu economies . • to develop models , identify and test areas for potential cost reduction opportunities on a range of case study projects , and any associated barriers , representative of residential construction projects currently being delivered . • to identify potential areas of construction cost reduction opportunities on a range of typical house types . • to disseminate findings to the constructi on sector . • to provide a reference for similar future construction cost studies . 2.4 study scope the study scope is to comprise actual residential construction costs for new build housing , apartment schemes and student accommodation . the findings may be applicable to any tenure . the cost study includes a cost estimating exercise based on , or adapted from actual residential schemes in ire , and comparison with comparable european locations through a benchmarking exercise covering , costs and cost -effective design . development costs , which comprise construction and soft costs , are detailed in the table 2 below . as identified in the scsi 2021 report , the real costs of new apartment delivery , construction costs make up approximately 50 % of total development costs in residential schemes . 26 table 2 : construction and soft costs construction costs soft costs direct building works including plant , labour and material site acquisition cost site development works ( roads , paths , services ) within site boundary professional design fees external works ( i.e . driveways , fencing , gardens , landscaping ) value added tax car parking ( i.e . basement , at grade parking ) legal & marketing costs on-site overheads ( i.e . preliminaries ) capital contributions , utility works outside the footprint of the building off-site overheads ( i.e . management and administration costs ) and builder ’ s margin6 development levies finance developer ’ s margin this study focus es on construction costs only . soft costs are outside the study scope . the study is further refined to focus on the direct building works costs and associated preliminaries of each case study project . as such , the following items are excluded from the costs presented in this study : • site development works ( roads , paths , services ) , including site abnormals ( e.g . poor ground conditions , contamination proximity to other structures ) • external works • car parking 6 included in construction costs in this study . 27 site characteristics and potentially local planning requirements influence for example site developme nt works and parking requirements . costs from one site to the next can be heavily influenced by site abnormalities . in addition , it is noted from a review of previous comparative studies that costs are not necessarily available on such items in other european locations7 . this study covers different types of residential buildings but is focused on the costs associated with the direct building works and associated preliminaries only . it is not the study ’ s intention to compare different building types ’ construction costs . the cost for a house differs from an apartment as they are fundamentally different in terms of complexity , construction materials and applicable building regulations and are appropriate to different locations . the cost data is project -specific . it is not intended to provide cost information for benchmarking purposes . 2.5 case study projects dhlgh with the steering group set out specific criteria for notional residential schemes in the study brief to facilitate cas e study project selection . these were intended to be representative of projects currently being delivered in ireland . these were in terms of housing scale , location and type , and with a sufficient level of detail to facilitate the overall study . the case s tudies had to align to the four notional residential schemes , or encompass a range of broad scheme criteria . the final selection of notional schemes was intended to allow for a detailed level of inquiry within the study timeframe , with transferable finding s to other housing typologies of similar construction or scale . central statistics o ffice ( cso ) data indicates that new dwelling completions in 2022 across all tenures amounted to 29,851 units . of these , scheme houses comprise d 15,163 ( 51 % ) and apartme nts comprised 9,166 ( 31 % ) . in 2022 , the average scheme house gfa was 118sqm 8 and apartment net floor area ( nfa ) wa s 7 this is noted for example in the housing agency ’ s 2018 report . 8 118sqm was the average for all scheme houses . the building control management system ( bcms ) commencement notice data for 2022 indicates that 46 % of houses commenced were 3bs and 39 % were 4bs . based on this data , 85 % of houses were either 3b or 4b houses . 28 75sqm . as such , the selection of case studies # 1 , # 2 and # 3 can be considered broadly representative of a large proportion of actual housing delivery in ireland at this time . the inclusion of case study # 4 , purpose built student accommodation ( pbsa ) , is due to high associated construction costs and the actions in housing for all to increase delivery of this housing type . this is a relatively narrow case study selection for a deep and detailed comparative study at a fixed point in time . in response to the notional schemes identified , case study projects were proposed which largely comply with the notional schemes set out . t he selected projects are located in ireland and are in compliance with building regulations that applied at time of site commencement . further details on the notional schemes and the case studies are provided in appendix a . 29 30 31 3.0 review of existing literatur e 3.1 overview this chapter undertakes a review of recent literature available on irish and international construction costs , including reports and cost indices , as well as literature and guidance on spatial and technical standards in the selected locations . the degree o f detail and basis for the costs varies or is not referenced in certain instances . publication dates vary and the cost information in the reference literature reflects this . the scope of inclusions and exclu sions also varies e.g . site curtilage / site work s are included in some figures but excluded in others . it is not intended that the costs in the literature review are compared with costs presented in this study . reference literature details are provided in appendix b . 3.2 irish construction costs constr uction costs in ire are published by various bodies including the scsi , and various private construction cost consultants . these costs tend to be dub focussed or national averages and typical ly are presented as a range . in 2018 , the dhlgh published a “ review of delivery costs and viability for affordable residential developments ” . in the area of construction costs , this report found there was a skills shortage in key construction trades for the short to medium term , which impacts on delivery capacity and on wage inflation . however , it also found that ‘ the industry itself must face the challenge to innovate in order to increase output while at the same time becoming less dependent on a large labour input , e.g . through increased utilisation of prefabricat ion methods ’ . in 2020 , the scsi published its updated report on the “ real cost of new housing delivery '' and noted that the construction cost of a three bed semi -detached hous e was €178,902 ( based on 114 sq m including site curtilage and site development costs ) which made up 48 % of total development costs ( €371,311 ) . the scsi report concluded with some recommendations for policymakers to address the housing crisis . similarly , in 2021 , the scsi published the updated report on apartment delivery cost , which covers total cost of development . f rom its analysis , the construction cost for a suburban two- bedroom apartment ( category 2 ) ranges from €191,000 to €253,000 . 32 urban apartment equivalent ( category 3 ) is in the range of €219,000 to €262,000 . these figures incl ude a portion for site works . the 2021 report also found that there were cost savings achieved largely due to the introduction of new apartment design guidelines in 2018 . it found , additionally , that construction costs of medium rise blocks made up 47 % of total costs , up from 43 % since 2017 , while soft costs made up 42 % and land 11 % . it also made recommendations across the full range of development costs to address viability including the use of modern methods of construction ( mmc ) . linesight , an internati onal construction consultancy , noted in their “ europe 2022 ” report that the typical construction cost s for the relevant residential buildings are as follows : a . suburban apartments range from €200,200 to 236,600 ( €2,200 to €2,600 per sqm and excluding substructure ) b . urban apartments range from €209,300 to 273,000 ( €2,300 to €3,000 per sq m and excluding substructure ) c. pbsa is noted with a range of €87,000 to €1 08,000 ( €2,900 to €3,600 per sqm ) 3.3 international construction costs the housing agency ( 2018 ) repor t , comparison of residential construction costs in ireland to other european countries , addressed a similar topic to this study but with a different approach . the study used location indices to establish differential s between ire and four comparison countries , namely , uk , france , germany and netherlands . the 2018 report covered construction costs only ( similar to this study ) and noted that ire was very similar to uk , france and germany . residential construction cost in ire was noted as 1.2 % below the uk index but 1.3 % and 2.9 % above the france and germany indices respectively . the netherlands index was noted as 18 % below the ire residential construction cost . this was based on national averages as opposed to regions or cities . the 2018 report also identified challenges with international benchmarking , due to different legislation , construction systems , and building types . 33 annual international cost reports published by global construction consultants identify cities and / or countries . turner & townsend and arcadis , among others , publish annual reports which cover some cities examined in this study . the t & t international construction market survey ( 2022 ) cited apartment construction costs in bhm to be very similar , i.e . within 3 % , of dub costs . the same report noted amsterdam to be circa 17 % less than dub , whilst cph and ber are not documented . international consultant arcadis provides a global index across all major cities in their international construction costs report 2022 . this captures general construction costs and does not identify particular building types . it notes construction costs in dub to be marginally less than cph and 15 to 20 % higher than bhm and ber respectively . the european council of construction econo mics ( ceec ) produces an annual cost model for a typical office building to compare construction costs between eu member states . the cost model is updated annually and is based on national averages . the most recent report ( 2021 ) noted i re and uk to be similar . d k was highlighted as being 29 % higher than ire while nl and ger were 5 % and 7 % l ess than dub respectively . this is summarised in table 3 below . table 3 : indexed international construction cost comparison ( various ) 9 costs based on amsterdam 10 costs based on amsterdam housing agen cy ( 2018 ) t & t ( 2022 ) arcadis ( 2022 ) ceec cost model ( 2021 ) cost coverage national average cities/ regions cities/ regions national average building type residential

studies and annual reports published by international construction consultancies . these studies vary in terms of their approach but for the most part , rely on location factors or cost -per-sqm of floor area , and range from national averages to specific regions or cities . the reports do recognise , to varying degrees , some of the challenges when comparing construction costs on an international level . the challenges identified include : • difficulties obtaining ‘ lik e for like ’ comparisons • varying definitions of building floor areas • costs which are typically analysed on a cost -per-sqm of floor area • large regional cost differences within countries • variations of construction details and materials between certain jurisdi ctions • differences of localised industry practices and approaches • currency fluctuations in germany , a construction cost reduction commission was established in 2014 with the main task to carry out an ‘ …analysis of the development of construction costs , identification of cost drivers in new construction and modernisation of residential buildings . ’ the report11 identified 71 recommendations for federal and local governments to consider . standardisation of work , uniformity of state building codes and re- densifi cation were some of the highlighted recommendations . 3.4 spatial standards varying levels of detail are set out in each jurisdiction for spatial standards . in ire and the uk , a prescriptive set of documents define minimum or target net floor areas ( nfa ) for various housing types . in ire , the design standards for new apartments ( 2018 ) sets out minimum nfas for apartments , as well as minimum living , bedroom and storage areas to satisfy normal living requirements . the quality housing for sustainable communit ies guidelines ( 2007 ) sets out target minimum nfas for houses and apartments , also referenced in the design manual for quality 11 neitzel , m. ( 2019 ) boosting the ( affordable ) housing supply – measures to reduce construction and development cost 35 housing ( 2022 ) . in the uk , the nationally described space standards ( ndss ) specifies similar prescriptive requirements for nfas across all housing types . standards in dk , nl and ger are typically based on the functional requirements in the building types in this study . local requirements have been located which describe performance criteria for certain rooms or spaces within dwelli ngs , b ut they do not prescribe minimum net floor areas ( nfas ) . irish institutional property ( iip ) published a paper in 2020 , ireland apartment sizes among largest in europe , which compared minimum apartment sizes for new developments in nine locations across various european countries . locations applicable to the scope of this study are noted in table 4 below . table 4 : iip minimum nfas comparison . 2020 * btr minimum sizes used . the research for the 2020 report was compiled by hines ireland , an international property developer , and cites that regulation of apartment design is ‘ …hi ghly nuanced across geographies and standards are complex… ’ based on project delivery in the market , the scsi ( 2021 ) report notes the 73 sqm nfa for a 2b4p apartment is difficult to achieve whilst meeting the various design standards ( e.g . bedroom dimensions , dual aspect ) and a 78.5 sqm nfa is used in the study . dwelling type dub * ( ireland ) london ( uk ) cph ( denmark ) amsterdam ( netherlands ) ber ( germany ) 1b2p apartment 45 sq m 50 sq m 41 sq m 40 sq m 45 sq m 2b4p apartment 73 sq m 70 sq m 69.7 sq m 65 sq m 75 sq m 3b5p apartment 90 sq m 86 sq m 86.1 sq m 70 sq m 90 sq m 36 3.5 technical standards limited literature exists which compares design s tandards and practices / norms across different european locations . the housing agency 2020 report , ‘ s ocial , affordable , and c o-operative housing in europe ’ presents a design comparison across european countries , including dk , nl and ger . among other findi ngs , it identified that the fit -out of apartments in ger is commonly left to the residents and that flexibility is incorporated into designs to allow for further changes in use / layout . buildings constructed in b hm , cph , utr and ber are all subject to building codes and regulations for fire safety , accessibility , energy performance and fitness for use , as well as health & safety legislation . nearly zero energy buildings ( nzeb ) is an eu requirement under the energy performance of buildings directive and applies across all member states . the uk adopted an energy performance standard similar to nzeb for residential buildings in 2022 . refer to appendix g for energy performance requirements . constructio n materials are also subject to eu construction products regulations . 37 38 39 4.0 methodology 4.1 introduction this section details the methodology adopted to achieve this study ’ s objectives ; formulated from the brief set out for the study , but also from drawing on the literature review which identified a number of challenges for international comparison on construction costs . this methodology chapter aims to address these as far as practical . 4.2 identification of comparison locations the study brief set out that construction costs in ireland should be compared against comparable eu economies , similar also in terms of climate , culture , level of housing , economic activity and cost of living . consequently , northern european countries were identified in the brief . in addition , regulatory contexts are similar - as detailed in the literature review . countries identified as suitable f or this study in the housing for all plan included denmark , netherlands and austria . the final selection of comparator countries are : united kingdom ( uk ) , denmark ( dk ) , netherlands ( nl ) , germany ( ger ) as identified in the housing agency report ( 2018 ) , significant regional cost differences can exist within national boundaries . f or example , greater dublin construction costs differ to other parts of the country . in response to this , nominated cities / regions within each comparison country were chosen for cost comparison . this is intended to refine cost comparisons and reduce the risk of national averages skewing the findings . the following nominated cities are used in the study : birmingham ( bhm ) , copenhagen ( cph ) , utrecht ( utr ) , berlin ( ber ) dublin ( dub ) is identified here as ireland ’ s nominated city for comparison purposes . this is due to the large volume of available construction cost data across housing typologies in dub , and its similarity to other northern european cities . all costs and technical -related data within this study are based on the nominated cities . for the purposes of the international cost comparison , exchange rates at the time of the costing exercise are applicable . further details are in appendix c. 40 4.3 adopted methodology based on the study objectives and reflecting on the challenges noted in the literature review above , the adopted methodology - developed to address these points and provide in- depth findings - is captured under two distinct and inter -related areas . these are analysed separately as follows : 1 . cost comparison a. travelling box b . local cost ranges 2 . design comparison a . scope b . unit sizing c. specification d. standards /regulations cost comparison using bills of quantities ( boq s ) , a baseline costing exercise , undertaken for each case study project , reflects dub costing levels applicable to q3 2022 . this baseline provides a point of reference for the international comparison . dub case study costing is referred to as the baseline costing . 41 recognising the challenges noted in the literature review above , the international cost comparison is on two levels . firstly , a detailed bill of quantities ( boqs ) was used to cost a typical irish dwelling as if it was built in the comparator locations in order to identify any noteworthy differences from a materials and labour cost perspective only . this invol ves a costing exercise of each case study to irish specifications using construction cost data from each reference location . no two projects are identical , a factor magnified when comparing against international projects . for example , local approaches , different regulations , standards , design efficiency and building technologies make establishing a true comparison difficult . therefore , t o limit the number of variables noted , the same building ( travelling box ) is costed in each location , i.e . each case study project is costed using the detailed design information and boqs . a set of costing instructions was provided at the study ’ s outset to the effect that each costing be undertaken , as far as practicable , on the same principles . table 5 below shows the hierar chy of cost data . table 5 : hierarchy of cost data ‘ travelling box ’ –using a detailed bill of quantities to cost a typical irish dwelling as if it was built in the comparator locations 42 the ‘ travelling box ’ costings are presented on a cost -per-sqm and cost -per- unit basis . in each case study , using , effectively , the same individual building , the cost-per-unit is based on the irish sizing ; hence , the findings for both units of measurement are identical . it is recognised that some details and construction approaches in the ‘ travelling box ’ will not represent normal approach es in certain locations . t hese were , theref ore , identified and costed as far as practicable . secondly , as a benchmarking exercise , costs for similar buildings types were compared based on local cost ranges for each location . these we re provided by the european cost consultant s based on their own c ost databases . the ‘ travelling box ’ comparison is , nonetheless , limited in that it does not recognise local or region- specific approaches . as such , local cost ranges are based on actual projects built using typical specifications for ea ch individual country or region/ city . this enables effective comparison between irish design approaches and those of comparator locations . local cost ranges are also presented on a cost -per-sqm and cost -per-unit basis . cost-per-sqm data is adjusted such that comparisons are based on the same principles for gfa . costs -per-unit are generated by adopting the cost -per-sqm ranges and unit sizing typically adopted in the respective locations , with unit sizing for each building type primarily calculated from samplings of actual project data for each location . where applicable , regard is taken of relevant design standards . this is explained in more detail under the design comparison . the two cost datasets , i.e . 'travelling box ’ costing and local cost ranges , were compared to id entify differences . all cost data is summarised into elemental categories for each individual location and housing type . elemental categories consist of : substructure , structure , external enclosure , roof enclosure , internal subdivision , internal finishes and fittings , building services and preliminaries . further details are set out in appendix d. elemental cost differences are presented as a percentage difference between the irish baseline ( dub ) and the lowest comparator , as well as in a table with the act ual elemental cost data . 43 design comparison design comparison identifies key differences under various headings , which may or may not have cost reduction opportunities . it is not intended to be an exhaustive comparison on all aspects of design across the f ive locations , but is instead aimed at identifying key differences . these may in turn illustrate further cost differences with potential benefit from further research . design is reviewed under the following headings : table 6 : areas for design comparison headings heading description scope comparison of scopes from local actual projects to dub actual projects e.g . fittings and finishes . unit sizing comparison of unit sizing across the five locations for house , apartments and student accommodation types . specification comparison of specifications across locations . this can include quality and type of product s or materials used and / or construction details beyond regulatory performance requirements . standards & regulations overview of comparisons in the areas of heading design standards ( if any ) and building regulations . design comparison is carried out on each building type . differences between the five locations identified for each building type during the cost and design comparison exercise are subsequently compiled for use in cost modelling exercises . a list of items under the above headings are set out in each case study c hapter . 4.4 cost modelling cost modelling involves modelling design and cost comparisons to reconcile the baseline unit cost ( dub ) against the lowest cost range ’ s average cost for each building type . the items modelled are set out in a table under the fol lowing headings : 44 table 7 : areas for cost modelling heading description scope adjustment for any scope differences unit sizing adjustment for unit sizing specification adjustment for notable specification differences the modelled costs are notional . whilst table 7 above indicates the items modelled for this exercise , it is not exhaustive and any changes would need to be assessed in the irish context , taking account of market acceptance , housing typologies and climate . the cost difference remaining after modelled costs due to scope , specification and unit sizing is indicated in the graph as the residual difference . the residual difference is due to a combination of factors , for example : respective market conditions , labour costs , and planning and building regulatory requirements in each location . 4.5 analysis a synthesis of the cost and design comparisons , and feedback from the workshops , is presented as a summary of findings to identify potential cost reduction opportunities , which can inform the recommendations and a set of actions to further develop these opportunities . 4.6 data collection based on the methodology set out above , the study uses data from various sources . the cost comparison uses primary cost data from dub and the selected european locations . this involves construction consultants in each location providing local costing data based on their own cost databases for the ‘ travelling box ’ costing , as well as cost ranges from actual projects and their respective in- house cost databases . secondary data and sources , such as literature , were referred to for cross checking cost data , where available . 45 the design comparison uses various data sources including : observations from local construction consultants , local design standards where available , and reviewing designs of actual projects . the types of data collection can be summarised as follows : table 8 : description of da ta types data type description primary data quantitative in -house cost data within irish consultancy and european cost consultancies qualitative observations of construction norms/practices by european cost consultants . design metrics generated from sampling of actual projects ( sample sizes set out in appendix f ) secondary data published literature and industry cost reports/ indices local design standards where available unless stated otherw ise , commentary presented in this study have been obtained from a combination of sources , including observations from european consultants and/or information reviewed . this is particularly the case for commentary on approaches to construction in the comparison locations . further infor mation on the data sources is set out in appendices c & f . 4.7 c ost per residential unit the cost comparison is presented on a cost -per-sqm of gross floor area ( gfa ) and cost -per-unit basis , similar to the scsi a partment report . to generate the latter cost , typical unit sizes by building type are established from each location . for the irish baseline house and apartment unit sizes , the design manual for quality housing ( 2022 ) , design standards for new apartments ( 2018 ) and quality housing for sustainable comm unities ( 2007 ) identify target / minimum nfas . for the irish baseline pbsa , dublin city council ’ s ( dcc ) local development plan identifies minimum requirements and is widely utilised by other local authorities . 46 in certain instances , the nfas and gfas used are based on actual project data . the rationale for this is explained here and summarised in table 9 below : • 3b5p semi -detached – the majority of dwellings in the study ’ s dub database range from 110 sqm to 123 sqm . the nfa and gfa of a house are the s ame . the house selected for case study # 1 is 123 sqm . an additional model of a 110 sqm house was also modelled as a sensitivity check for the lower end of the dub cost range . • 2b4p apartment – case studies # 2 and # 3 use a 91 sqm gfa ( 78.5 sqm nfa ) which is based on the study database of actual projects being designed and delivered and takes account of the scsi ( 2021 ) report ’ s basis for unit sizing . • student bedspace – based on the study database of 5,300 student beds delivered in ireland over the last 6 years , 30 sqm is average gfa per bedspace . table 9 : dub unit sizing used in the study housing type unit type areas for study case study # 1 3b5p semi

) 47 similar data has been collated from the comparator locations . for the uk , the nationally described space standards ( ndss ) is referred to for unit sizing which provides a prescriptive set of spatial standards for different types of residential units with the exception of pbsa . cph , ber and utr ha ve different functional spatial requirements , which could be described as performance- based rather than prescriptive . the gfas and nfas used in this study are based on a sampling of projects ( see appendices ) in each location . for all locations , actual project data has been used as a basis for establishing the sqm sizing per bedspace on pbsa building type . refer to appendices for further details . the unit sizing used in this study are set out in table 10 below . net floor area

summary of dub baseline costs 5.0 case study # 1 – scheme house 5.1 outline irish specification this case study project is a 3b5p semi -detached house with a g ross floor area ( gfa ) of 123 sqm . the house is a timber frame construction with block/brick external leaf and timber truss roof . the front elevation has brick with render on block finish to side and rear . the windows are double- glazed with fibre cement tiles to the roof . the heating source is an air source heat pump and heat recovery unit . the costs assume a fully fitted out house . refer to appendix e for the outline specification . 5.2 baseline irish costing figure 2 below shows the baseline unit construction cost ( €179,561 ) and the proportional breakdown into the main building elements based on the costed boqs . as noted in the methodology , this cost also excludes the costs of site development works , external works and car parking . the cost of structure is significant at 33 % , as are the internal finishes and fittings ( 17 % ) and building services ( 14 % ) . €179,561 per 3b5p unit ( 123 sqm ) 52 5.3 cost comparison – travelling box costing the comparison on case study # 1 is between dub and bhm only . the ‘ travelling box ’ is not costed in cph , utr and ber as this type is not typically built , based on discussions on european cost consultants , and cost range data is not available . the costs are shown in two formats in figure 3 below , cost -per-sqm of gfa and cost -per-unit . the results indicate that the bhm ‘ travelling box ’ costing is approximately 15 % less than dub on both cost -per-sqm ( €212 difference ) and cost - per-unit ( €26,067 difference ) . figure 3 : case study # 1 ‘ travelling box ’ cost comparison €179,561/unit €153,494/unit€1,460/m2 €1,248/m2

from substructure , the dub baseline costing is higher across all elemental categories than bhm . the most notable elements are internal sub- division ( 25 % less in bhm ) , external enclosure ( 24 % less in bhm ) , building services ( 22 % less in bhm ) and preliminaries ( 26 % lower in bhm ) . a combination of labour and material costs forms the main difference across the first three . for example , unit rates for items within the internal sub- division category such as internal doors , skirting , and architraves are in the region of 30 % less in bhm than dub . the preliminaries cost is a percentage of construction costs and the cost difference is mainly generated by the difference in overall costs . 5.4 cost comparison – european ( uk only ) benchmarking in this section , local cost ranges from the irish and uk cost consultants ’ cost databases are compared to the ‘ travelling box ’ cost -per-sqm in the orange box as a benchmarking exercise . t he 110 sqm ( lower range ) house is included as a comparison , as explained under the methodology chapter . this allows identification of any notable differences other than the cost difference noted above . the ‘ travelling box ’ cost -per-sqm is within the cost -per-sqm range in each category . figure 5 : case study # 1 local cost ranges vs. travelling box cost per sqm €1,321/m2 €1,321/m2 €1,238/m2€1,460/m2€1,534/m2

comparison . the cost -per-unit is assessed below under ‘ unit sizing ’ . using the headings identified in the methodology , both the 123 sqm and 110 sqm dub dwellings are compared to the bhm dwelling to ident ify differences , which may have a cost impact . cost as per the findings under the ‘ travelling box ’ exercise , the following areas are identified as having a notable cost difference . • timber frame and carcassing works ( structure ) ( 6 % less in bhm ) • timber jo inery / fittings ( internal fittings & finishes , internal sub- division ) ( 15 % less in bhm ) • brickwork / blockwork ( external enclosure ) ( 50 % less in bhm ) • building services ( 22 % less in bhm ) scope dub and bhm are similar on scope ; however , the following observations are noted from the uk cost consultants • fitted joinery ( other than kitchen ) is typically not provided in bhm ( internal finishes / fittings ) • level of finishes tends to vary in houses in bhm ( internal finishes / fittings ) • ensuites to master bedroom s are often omitted in bhm ( see unit sizing ) ( internal sub- division , internal finishes / fittings , building services ) unit sizing based on the minimum allowable unit sizing , dub and bhm have similar requirements for 3b5p semi -detached ( see methodology ) . a number of examples of developments designed and constructed to the uk ’ s minimum sizing ( 93sqm 12 ) are 12 the minimum nfa for a 3b5p two- storey dwelling in the uk ’ s ndss ( 2015 ) . 56 identified in bhm . based on discussions with various industry stakeholders and a review of designs , built examples of 3b5p at about 98- 100sqm have been i dentified in dub but with reduced scope . the case study project is based on 123 sqm , but a 110 sqm has also been modelled to present the lower end of the range of actual projects being delivered of comparable scope . the key difference between these two si zes is that rooms are more compact , but the scope remains largely consistent . as the gfa reduces closer to 100 sqm and below , scope changes materialise . for example , in the 93sqm house , the master ensuite is generally omitted ; additionally , in the uk , the kitchen can be accessed through the living room ( i.e . corridor is omitted ) . the cost ranges are shown below on a cost -per-unit basis . the cost per typical 3b5p semi -detached house in bhm ( 93 sqm ) ranges from 21 % less than the 110 sqm dub house ( lower end of range ) to 29 % less than the 123 sqm dub house ( upper end of range ) . however , the unit sizing typically being built in dub is 15 % ( 110 sqm ) to 24 % ( 123 sqm ) larger than bhm . figure 6 : 3b5p house cost per unit based on local cost range 162,487 145,314 115,121 194,985 174,377 138,145

following observations are noted from the uk cost consultants : • 100 % brick coverage to elevations in bhm compared to typically brick to fr ont elevation only with render on block to sides and rear in dub . the bhm specification would add cost to the dub equivalent . a lower labour and material cost is evident for brick -laying from the costed boqs in bhm than in dub ( external enclosure ) • rational ised electrical fittings - quantity of power points and pendant lights only ( i.e . no downlights ) ( building services ) standards/regulations designs are similar , but some differences are noted which are linked to design guidelines and regulatory requirements . for example , bhm cost ranges are based on actual projects with gas -fired boilers . some of the regulations on u- values are different , which can be linked to some of the cost difference . uk regulations will change in 2023 in this regard with an increased focus on low carbon heating systems and advanced u- values for the uk reference dwelling . further details on energy performance requirements are available in appendix g. 58 5.5 cost modelling cost modelling involves modelling design and cost comparisons to reconcile the baseline unit cost ( €179,851 ) against the lowest average comparator . in this case , bhm is the lowest average construction cost ( €127,000 ) based on the cost range noted in figure 6 above ( €115,121- €138,145 ) . the items modelled are set out in table 12 below . cost differences of the modelled items are notional . whilst table 12 indicates the items modelled for this exercise , it is not exhaustive and any changes would need to be assessed in the irish context , taking account of market acceptance , housing typologies and climate . table 12 : case study # 1 cost modelled items

found lower scheme house costs in bhm the ‘ travelling box ’ exercise found that construction costs using irish specifications on a cost -per-sqm rate for the same scheme house were approximately 15 % lower in bhm than in dub . • cost ranges for actual scheme houses are lower in bhm lower construction costs were also evident in bhm for an actual scheme house when built using the typical specifications for bhm . the cost -per-sqm rate was 6- 10 % lower in bhm than dub and the cost -per-unit basis was 21- 29 % lower in bhm than dub . this is due to a number of factors set ou t below . • cost and design comparison found differences in size and specification in bhm cost comparison indicates that uk can achieve a lower construction cost due to local market conditions and labour costs . this applies to both the ‘ travelling box ’ and actual scheme houses . design comparison indicates differences in scope , unit sizing and specification , which lead to a lower cost in bhm than dub for actual scheme houses . on scope , typically no -ensuite or fitted wardrobes are included in the 3- bedroom semi -detached scheme house in bhm . on unit sizing , the benchmark sampling for this study indicates that houses being delivered in bhm13 are up to 15 % ( 93 sqm vs 110 sqm ) smaller than dub . • cost modelling found potential cost reduction opportunities on unit sizing by adopting some of the design comparison findings , the modelled cost -per-unit is reconciled within 21 % of bhm average construction cost . opportunities on the scheme house are primarily linked to size . potential opportunities for cost reduction also exist in scope and specification to a lesser extent . 13 this unit size comparison is in the private- for-sale market . 61 62 63 substructure 3 %

internal finishes / fittings roof enclosure external enclosure internal sub-division structure substructure 66 table 13 above shows that there are cost differences between elements across the respective locations with no location consistent ly having the highest or lowest costs . for instance , dub is 22 % less than ber on substructure but 1 % more on structure . dub is the most location for building services with the range in other locations from 5 % less ( bhm ) to 34 % less ( ber ) . for the european consultants , the costing of individual items , and therefore distribution of costs to the respective elements , was a challenge due to the level of detail in the boqs . this is identified later among challenges encountered in the study . 6.4 cost comparison – european benchmarking the ‘ travellin g box ’ costing indicates overall similar cost -per-sqm ( +/- 4 % ) in the five locations . in the next step , the five local cost -per-sqm ranges for suburban apartments are compared with the five ‘ travelling box ’ costings ( cost -per-sqm ) . figure 12 below shows contrasting findings between the two cost comparison exercises . local cost -per-sqm ranges in dub and bhm are similar , i.e . within 5 % . however , there is a notable difference when dub is compared against cph , utr and ber . the cost difference ranges from - 17 % ( utr ) -20 % ( cph ) , and - 31 % ( ber ) when compared to dub . f urther comparison is required to understand the reasons behind these cost differences because the previous sections ( i.e . ‘ travelling box ’ ) illustrate that if the same building is costed , similar overall cost -per-sqm ( +/ -4 % ) are evident . 67 figure 12 : case study # 2 local cost ranges vs. travelling box using the headings identified in the methodology , the dub apartment is compared to the four comparator locations . cost the ‘ travelling box ’ comparison demonstrates that overall costs are largely similar across all locations but that there are greater differences between individual elements . these main differences are : • concrete and reinforcement rates are up to 40 % more in cph , ber and utr than in dub . refer to appendix i for composite rates comparison . ( substructure/ structure ) • building services are up to 30 % less in ber than dub . refer to table 13 above . • bathroom pods are more commonly used in apartment buildings in dub and bhm and are up to 50 % less than cph , ber or utr .

berlinhigher range lower range travelling box € / m2 68 whilst there are cost differences between individual elements , cost alone is not the main difference on the comparison of the local cost ranges . scope dub and bhm are similar on scope . some key differences ( with relevant elemental categories in brackets ) appear when comparing dub with cph , utr and ber , for example : • level of fit -out to apartments tends to vary . ‘ grey box ’ ( i.e . excluding kitchens , white goods , fitted joinery , and flooring ) approach tends to be commonly used in cph , ber and utr ( internal finishes / fittings ) . • two and three- bedroomed apartments tend to have one bathroom in cph ( i.e . no ensuite to master bedroom ) ( multiple elemental categories ) . • exposed concrete slab ( i.e . no suspended ceilings ) in apartments is common . soffits of concrete slabs are painted only ( i nternal finishes / fittings ) . see figure 13 below . • rationalised electrical fittings in a typical apartment , e.g . power points , pendant lights ( building services ) . figure 13 : indicative apartment interior wit h exposed concrete slab as the ceiling and surface -mounted light fittings . 69 • light fittings are not always provided . it is common for light fittings to be fitted by the end- user/ tenant ( internal finishes / fittings ) . • cph and ber benefit from a municipality level district heating network , which removes the need for dedicated central plant rooms or individual heating systems ( building services ) . unit sizing as described in the methodology , construction costs on a cost -per-unit are also analysed . local cost ranges are multiplied by unit sizing ( see methodology ) to generate a cost -per-unit range . this provides a lower and higher cost range for typical 2b4p apar tment with the exception of cph . 2b4p apartments are not typically constructed , hence 3b4p is used for the unit sizing , based on the review of actual designs from cph . figure 14 below shows the cost ranges . figure 14 : 2b4p apartment cost per unit based on local cost ranges due to variations in unit sizing ( i.e . cph - 8 % smaller and utr +21 % larger ) , the cost-per-unit provides a different c omparison to the cost -per-sqm . for instance : • utr is circa 17 % less than dub on cost -per-sqm but on an average cost -per- unit is similar ( i.e . within 4 % on lower range ) . 233,688 234,449 147,586 223,354 176,681 254,436 265,983 212,524 265,610 212,017 050,000100,000150,000200,000250,000300,000 dublin 91 sq.m birmingham 89 sq.m copenhagen 84 sq.m utrecht 110 sq.m

cost -per-sqm . specification dub and bhm were similar on specification . cph , ber and utr ha ve a number of specification differences with observations from the european cost consultants noted below . • traditional stud partition walls are not as common . load bearing concrete / pre-cast or gypsum block14 are adopted instead ( internal sub- division/ external enclosure ) . • upvc windows are commonly adopted in ber . composite aluminium and timber windows ( i.e . aluclad ) are seen as a premium product , but in dub aluclad is seen as a standard speci fication on apartment buildings ( external enclosure ) . • external wall build- ups and detailing are notably different . cph , ber and utr tend to use a single leaf with insulation or a sandwich panel type system ( a type of mmc ) , as opposed to system typically adopted in dub ( i.e . large cavities , structural steel angles to carry masonry external leaf ) ( external enclosure ) . • traditional labour -intensive trades such as brickwork and blockwork are either not used or used minimally in cph , ber and utr . panellised faç ade systems ( a type of mmc ) are adopted mostly instead ( external enclosure ) . • cph adopts pre- fabrication of building elements more than dub . however , bathrooms pods a re not as common in apartment buildings in cph , ber and utr ( multiple elemental categories ) . 14 http : //bauservice- stephan.com/documents/mg_gypsumpanels_en.pdf 71 • standardisation of components ( e.g . windows , doors ) is particularly common in cph . products are specified from standard supplier / manufacturer range ( external enclosure ) . • exposed concrete walls are common ( i.e . no dry lining to walls ) with paint finish only in cph , ber and utr ( internal fittings/finishes ) . • building services var y between locations , but some diffe rences include : o water supply direct from mains with metering in each apartment in cph and ber . o heat exchanger from district heating system ( als o noted under scope ) . o limited / no lighting provided in cph and ber ( noted under scope ) . • deck access apartments are common in cph and utr . standards/ regulations dub and bhm are similar . however , some differences exist , which are linked to design guidelines and regulatory requirements ( when comparing dub with cph , utr and be r ) which indicate cost impacts : • external wall build- ups ( as noted under specification ) most likely driven by local building regulations . • regulations do not require s prinklers in equivalent residential buildings in cph , ber and utr and therefore , are not typically installed . • performance based spatial requirements in cph , ber and utr ( as noted under methodology ) . the cph municipal plan 2019 notes that 50 % of the buildin g gfa must consist of units of at least 95 sqm15 on average to meet needs for families . the remaining 50 % of building gfa can be used to build smaller units . the minimum allowable unit size is 50 sqm in suburban areas and 40sqm in urban areas . 15 link to the municipal plan https : //kp19.kk.dk/retningslinjer/boliger -og-byliv/boligstoerrelser 72 • based on a sample of projects16 , dub designs appear more efficient overall when key design metrics are compared ( see table 14 below ) . the average net-to-gross ( nfa : gfa ) ratio in cph , ber and utr is influenced by deck access arrangement in some projects . • utr and cph have a number of examples of deck access housing with benefits from cross ventilation . table 14 : design efficiency comparison location apartments per core dual aspect nfa : gfa dub 8 –

comparisons to reconcile the baseline unit cost against the lowest average comparator . in this case , cph is the lowest average construction cost ( €180,000 ) based on the cost range noted in figure 14 above ( €147,586- €212,524 ) . the items modelled are set out in table 15 below . cost differences of the modelled items are notional . whilst table 15 indicates the items modelled for this exercise , it is not exhaustive and any changes would need to be assessed in the irish context , taking account of market acceptance , housing typologies and climate . 16 based on the following

exercise found similar apartment construction costs in all locations the ‘ travelling box ’ exercise found that overall construction costs using irish specifications on a cost -per-sqm rate for the same apartment building are broadly in line ( +/ - 4 % ) with construction costs in the four european comparator locations . • cost ranges for actual apartment building s are lower in cph , ber and utr lower construction costs were evident in cph , ber and utr than dub ( and bhm ) for actual apartment buildings when built using the typical specifications for those locations on a cost -per-sqm rate ( up to 3 1 % differences identified ) . • cost and design comparison found differences in scope , size and specifications in cph , ber and utr on the design comparison , cost differences were identified related to differences in scope , unit sizing and specification . it is common in cph , ber and utr to sell or rent apartments with exposed concrete slab ( bare ceilings ) , no floor finish , no 76 fitted wardrobes , no light fittings and sometimes minimal or no fitted kitchen . in addition , it is common for apartments to have a single bathroom shared between two or three bedrooms and no ensuites . stakeholders providing feedback during the study ’ s stage 2 workshop noted that some of these scope and specification choices are market driven , and some may require further assessment in relation to achieving technical performance requirements including sound , hygiene and fire . when typical constructi on practices in two locations are compared , it is difficult , and not always possible to quantify cost impacts of all differences in individual regulations , standards or norms . not all standards and regulations are prescriptive . for example , cph , ber and ut r requirements for apartment sizes are more performance- based than prescriptive and a significant range of apartment sizes is evident in these locations . • cost modelling found potential cost reduction opportunities on scope and specification by modelling t he items identified in the comparison findings on the case study projects ’ irish baseline unit cost , the cost-per-unit is reconciled to within 18 % of the lowest comparison which was cph . potential cost reduction opportunities on apartments are primarily linked to scope and standardisation . increased use of standardisation in construction systems and specification of components such as windows is evident in the cph , ber and utr for apartments . manufactured panel systems ( a type of mmc ) are more common in cph , ber and utr than labour -intensive site -based activities ( such as block - or brick -laying ) . cph , ber and utr also deliver a higher proportion of apartments with associated efficiencies . stakeholders in stage 2 workshop noted that diversity in the design and appearance of housing can increase construction costs . diversity also makes it more challenging to increase standardisation , including materials selection . 77 78 7.0 case study # 3 – urban apartments 7.1 outline irish specification a seven- storey apartment block is the selected case study for the urban apartments with a building gfa of approximately 5,500 sqm . the structure consists of precast walls and precast concrete slabs . the external façade is finished with brick outer leaf , precast walls inner leaf and double- glazed aluclad windows with sliding doors to balconies . the roofs are a mix of standing seam on profiled metal roofs and green roof covering to flat areas . the block is serviced through an exhaust air heat pump supplying hot water and heating . b athrooms are prefabricated pods and the apartments are fully fitted out with kitchens , white goods an d wardrobes to bedrooms . refer to appendix e for full outline specification . 7.2 baseline irish costing figure 16 below shows the baseline unit construction cost ( €255,037 ) and the breakdown into the main building elements . this is based on a 2b4p apartment at 91 sqm gfa generated from the building ’ s cost -per-sqm rate . as noted in the methodology , the baseline unit cost excludes the costs of site development works , external works and car -parking . structure ( 20 % ) , services ( 21 % ) and internal fittings & finishes ( 15 % ) are again significant costs , along with the external enclosure ( 13 % ) and prelims ( 15 % ) . figure 16 :

to case study # 2 apart from bhm , which increases to 95 sqm ( 89 sqm in case study # 2 ) based on the sampl ing of projects analysed . in figure 20 below , the unit sizing noted previously is multiplied by the local cost -per- sqm range in each location to provide a cost -per-unit r ange . due to the variance in unit sizing , the cost -per-unit provides a different comparison to the cost -per-sqm . for instance ; • utr is 19 % less than dub on cost -per-sqm compared to 6 % on cost -per-unit . • ber is 33 % less than dub on cost -per-sqm but 26 % on cos t-per-unit • cph is 38 % less

ber . • bathroom pods are frequently used in pbsa in dub and bhm , so are less than the other locations . • preliminaries in dub are notably less than utr and ber . it would appear that while there are cost differences betwe en individual elements that cost alone is not the main difference on the local cost comparison . scope there are differences in scope across the five comparator locations . some observations on scope differences when comparing dub ( and bhm ) to cph , ber and u tr are noted below : • furniture , fixtures and equipment ( ff & e ) ( both fitted & loose ) are typically excluded from construction costs and procured separately by the operator . • exposed concrete slab in bedrooms / studios is common ( i.e . no suspended ceiling ) . soffits of concrete slabs are left exposed or painted only . • rationalised electrical fittings , i.e . quantity o f power points , pendant li ghts . • district heating servicing buildings in cph and ber remov es the need for dedicated central plant . • studio / one bedroom apartment type units are more common in cph , utr and ber as opposed to cluster -style arrangements in dub and bhm . figure 26 : example of exposed concrete slab ( unpainted ceiling ) f inish in a student studio 93 unit sizing as set out in the methodology chapter , average sqm of gfa per bedspace is generated based on respective local design approaches to provide unit sizing for comparison . as stated above , this varies due to the cluster vs studio type units adopted in respective locations . a cost -per-unit range is then calculated by multiplying the average sqm of gfa per bedspace in each location by the local cost ranges ( in cost -per-sqm ) in the respective location . this generates a lower and higher cost range for a typical bed space . dub and bhm have the best efficiencies of gfa per bedspace due to a preference for cluster style units . once the unit sizing is applied to the local cost ranges , the comparison to the other locations changes . • cph is over 30 % less than dub on cost -per-sqm but reduces to 20 % less on a cost -per-unit . • utr reduces to 16 % above dub on a cost -per-unit compared to 28 % on cost-per-sqm . • difference to bhm and ber reduce marginally from the cost -per-sqm comparison . this change on the costs is due to the unit si zing and overall efficiency . this forms part of the modelling in the next section . 94 figure 27 : case study # 4 – cost -per-unit based on local cost ranges specification the pbsa specification is similar in dub and bhm . the differences between dub (

case study # 2 for the design differences between dub ( and bhm ) and cph , utr and ber . 8.5 cost modelling cost modelling involves modelling design and cost comparisons to reconcile the baseline unit costs ( €97,044 ) against the lowest average comparator . in this case , ber is the lowest average construction cost ( €75,400 ) based on the cost range noted in figure 27 above ( €69,000-

found higher pbsa costs in european locations the ‘ travelling box ’ exercise found that overall construction costs using irish specifications on a cost -per-sqm rate for the same pbsa building are higher ( up to 11 % ) in the four european comparator locations albeit with the costs distributed differently between the building elements . • cost ranges for actual pbsa buildings are lower in cph , ber and utr lower construction costs were evident in cph , ber and utr for actual pbsa buildings when built using the typical specifications for those locations on a cost - per-sqm rate ( 10 % to 32 % differences identified ) . • cost and design comparison found differences in scope , size and specification in cph , ber and utr on the design comparison , the study found that dub typically builds a different typology to cph , ber and utr . these european locations design and build 97 more studio/ 1-bedroom units as opposed to the 6 to 8 beds per cluster arrangement common in dub ( and bhm ) . when typical construction practices in two locations are compared , it is difficult , and not always possible to quantify cost impacts of all differences in individual regulations , standards or norms . not all standards and regulations are prescriptive . increased use of standardisation in construction systems and specification of components such as windows is evident in pbsa in cph , ber and utr . manufactured panel systems ( a type of mmc ) are more common i n cph , ber and utr than labour -intensive site- based activities ( such as block - or brick - laying ) . • cost modelling found potential cost reduction opportunities on scope and specification by adopting some of the findings and modelling them against the case study project , the cost-per-unit is reconciled to within 11 % of the lowest comparator location ( ber ) . the value of having a design standard for pbsa with typology options ( clusters , ensuites/ shared bathrooms , studios ) and applications ( on- campus/ off -campu s ) was discussed at the stage 2 stakeholder workshop . there is currently no national design standard for pbsa . potential cost reduction opportunities for pbsa were identified as design standards and unit sizing , as well as scope and specification . 98 99 100 9.0 engagement with stakeholders 9.1 intro duction to maximise stakeholder engagement , workshops were hosted at the completion of study stages 1 , 2 , and 3 . this was to provide updates and context to stakeholders and to gather their feedback . each workshop theme is listed below : • workshop 1 - completion of stage 1 ( irish baseline costing exercise ) • workshop 2 – completion of stage 2 ( european construction cost comparison , ‘ travelling box ’ and local benchmarking ) • workshop 3 – completion of stage 3 ( cost modelling and analysis ) summary notes from each stakeholder workshop are provided below . further details and a register of attendees is available in appendix h. during each workshop t he scope , methodology and findings at each stage were discussed and questions clarified . feedback was integrated where applicable and comments considered in terms of both this and potential future studies . 9.2 workshop 1 the consultants placed emphasis here on clarifying construction cost differences between locations . these differences were based on processes and practices . questions from stakeholders and subsequent responses centred on broad cost - drivers , as well as potential cost -mitigates such as in the context of modern methods of construction . other questions applied to mechanical and electrical engineering , waste and labour costs , as well as the possible cost impacts of forms of contract and risk variations between locations . engineering / waste / labour were deemed within ; and contract forms / risk variations deemed outside of study scope . notably , inconsis tency within both planning practices and regulatory requirements was raised as a recurring challenge by stakeholders . additionally , the inclusion of other housing types in the context of density was raised as warranting future consideration . 101 9.3 workshop 2 following further overview and update , and subsequent presentations by the consultants , breakout groups were formed from stakeholder attendees ; each group focussing on one of the three building types ( house / apartment s / pbsa ) . three common questions were then p ut to each group as follows : • could approaches from the comparator locations such as those related to scope , specification and increased standardisation be applied within ire ? • what challenges might inhibit / impede such approaches ? • any other recommendations were sought specific to housing type to support cost reduction , e.g . those related to standardisation , building services , mmc , housing design or construction materials/systems . a number of themes fed back from the presentations and breakout groups . the following comments give an impression of the wide- ranging discussion . building regulations • less demanding regulatory requirements appear to apply in some areas among comparator locations e.g . fire safety & accessibility . it was noted that a comprehensive comparative study of regulations is outside the scope of this study and that regulatory requirements do need to be understood in their full context . • the potential cost benefit s of mid-rise ( 3 -4 storey ) walk -up apartment building types common in european cities were highlighted . such designs , however , need to be understood in their wider regulatory context , which inhibits their delivery in ireland . • the importance of consistency of application of irish building regulations was emphasised . frequent regulatory changes were also deemed challeng ing . • building services were found to have a higher cost in ireland across all dwelling types . district heating , more common in cph and ber , could reduce cost s. 102 construction systems & processes • repetition of processes and systems is more prominent in europe and if implemented more broadly in ireland would reduce costs here . • ‘ dry ’ construction processes ( such as taped as opposed to skimmed linings ) are common in the uk and could reduce cost in ireland . • support is needed for more offsite construction systems ( mmc ) . it was noted that any guidance on standardisation of plans and/or components should be accompanied by performance and economic best practice guidance . • irish cavity external wall construction was noted as adding to cost . alternatives could reduce cost . scope , specification & finishes • it is more common in european cities to omit items from scope such as kitchens and/or appliances , fitted wardrobes , suspended ceilings . these omissions resul t in reduced costs . • the concept of ‘ gr ey-box ’ came up in feedback . however , c ompliance with building control ( amendment ) regulations was deemed challenging for implementation of ‘ grey -box ’ domestically . • standardisation ( of components such as windows ) is more widespread in europe and could reduce costs in ireland . the precedent of the georgian house was cited as an example of effective standardisation . planning requirements & processes • stakeholder feedback suggested that design requirements for the appearance of housing can increase costs . this factor also inhibits standardisation , including materials selection . • it was noted by stakeholders in the stage 2 workshop that further standardised guidance for student accommodation would be of benefit . national design guidance for student accommodation would inform design approaches . a range of design options for students would be preferable , incl . 103 small studios and clustered bed- spaces , both with and without ensuites . shared rooms was also suggested as an option . 9.4 workshop 3 following a further recap / overview , the consultants , using powerpoint , drew reference from their findings to the significant impact of scale on costs , the ‘ like- for- like ’ application to scope , as well as specification and metho dology differences between comparator locations . the potential benefits of increased standardisation were underscored . fundamentally , the consultants detailed that the study does not indicate any particular ‘ silver -bullet ’ solution , but does instead illus trate an aggregation of ‘ grey - pellets ’ , i.e . cost reduction opportunities that could be applied both individually and incrementally . the study specifically identifies numerous irish residential construction industry practi ces that differ from comparator locations which impact on construction costs . in addition , stakeholders alluded to the impact of construction programmes on construction cost and forms of contract on the overall construction costs . a shorter construction programme and the allocation of ris k in the form of contract could potentially lead to cost reduction . concluding , a number of key findings from stakeholders were discussed , and particular emphasis was placed on development of actions to be taken following the study . 9.5 summary of findings • building services costs are higher in dub building services costs were found to be higher in dub than other locations across all dwelling types . amongst one of the main areas of difference , district heating , i.e . cph , as opposed to site- based heat generation , which is adopted in ireland . • other dwelling types required stakeholders at the stage 2 and stage 3 workshops noted the importance of considering other dwelling typologies to achieve a medium level of density , which may have potential cost reduction opportunities . 104 • design standard for pbsa beneficial it was noted by stakeholders in the stage 2 workshop that further standardised guidance would be of benefit . national design guidance for student accommodation would inform design approaches . a range of design options for students would be preferable , incl . small studios and clustered bed- spaces , both with and without ensuites . shared rooms was also suggested as an option . • opportunity for standardisation potential benefits of increased standardisation were cited by stakeholders in the workshops . support is needed for more offsite construction systems and components , such as modern methods of construction ( mmc ) . it was noted that any guidance on standardisation of plans and/or components should be accompanied by performance and economic best practice guidance . • application of planning guidance feedback noted that the variation in the application of planning design requirements for the appearance of housing can increase costs . this also makes it more challenging to increase standardisation , including materials selection . • further studies required areas for further studies which were raised included the areas of soft costs , cost impact of construction programme and cost impact of different forms of contract . 105 106 10.0 summary of findings 10.1 findings findings from each case study and from the workshops are summarised below . in addition , a number of specific findings are listed in appendix j , which informed the choice of modelled items in the cost modelling exercise . in addit ion , a key finding from the literature review is the need to avoid comparing construction costs based on the top line or level , which ignore fundamental differences . significant scope , which is omitted from the reported construction cost and displaced to r esidents or others , should be factored into construction cost comparison as a minimum . 10.2 general findings 10.2.1 case study ( cs ) # 1 - scheme house • ‘ travelling box ’ exercise found lower scheme house costs in bhm the ‘ travelling box ’ exercise found that construction costs using irish specifications on a cost -per-sqm rate for the same scheme house were approximately 15 % lower in bhm than in dub . • cost ranges for actual scheme houses are lower in bhm lower construction costs were also evident in bhm for an actual scheme house when built using the typical specifications for bhm . the cost -per-sqm rate was 6- 10 % lower in bhm than dub and the cost -per-unit basis was 21- 29 % lower in bhm than dub . this is due to a number of f actors set out below . • cost and design comparison found differences in size and specification in bhm cost comparison indicates that uk can achieve a lower construction cost due to local market conditions 18 and labour costs . this applies to both the ‘ travell ing box ’ and actual scheme houses . design comparison indicates differences in scope , unit sizing and specification , which lead to a lower cost in bhm than dub for actual scheme houses . on 18 this refers to scale , supply and demand of goods and services , imported goods , population base , regulatory framework of the construction sector which is unique or local to a particular locati on . 107 scope , typically no -ensuite or fitted wardrobes are included in the 3-bedroom semi -detached scheme house in bhm . on unit sizing , the benchmark sampling for this study indicates that houses being delivered in bhm19 are up to 15 % ( 93 sqm vs 110 sqm ) smaller than dub . • cost modelling found potential cost reduction opportunities on unit sizing by adopting some of the design comparison findings , the modelled cost -per-unit is reconciled within 21 % of bhm average construction cost . opportunities on the scheme house are primarily linked to size . potential opportunities for cost reduction also exist in scope and specification to a lesser extent . 10.2.2 case studies ( cs ) # 2 & # 3 – suburban and urban apartments • ‘ travelling box ’ exercise found similar apartment construction costs in all locations the ‘ travelling box ’ exerc ise found that overall construction costs using irish specifications on a cost -per-sqm rate for the same apartment building are broadly in line ( +/ - 4 % for cs # 2 and up to +9 % for cs # 3 ) with construction costs in the four european comparator locations . • cost ranges for actual apartment buildings are lower in cph , ber and utr lower construction costs were evident in cph , ber and utr than dub ( and bhm ) for actual apartment buildings when built using the typical specifications for those locations on a cost -per-sqm rate ( up to 30 % differences identified ) . • cost and design comparison found differences in scope , size and specifications in cph , ber and utr on the design comparison , cost differences were identified related to differences in scope , unit sizing and specification . it is common in cph , ber and utr to sell or rent apartments with exposed concrete slab ( bare ceilings ) , no floor finish , no fitted wardrobes , no light fittings and sometimes minimal or no fit ted kitchen . in addition , it is common for apartments to have a single bathroom shared between 19 this unit size comparison is in the private- for-sale market . 108 two or three bedrooms and no ensuites . stakeholders providing feedback during the study ’ s stage 2 workshop noted that some of these scope and specification choic es are market driven , and some may require further assessment in relation to achieving technical performance requirements including sound , hygiene and fire . when typical construction practices in two locations are compared , it is difficult , and not always possible to quantify cost impacts of all differences in individual regulations , standards or norms . not all standards and regulations are prescriptive . for example , cph , ber and utr requirements for apartment sizes are more performance- based than prescript ive and a significant range of apartment sizes is evident in these locations . • cost modelling found potential cost reduction opportunities on scope and specification by modelling the items identified in the comparison findings on the case study projects ’ irish baseline unit cost , the cost-per-unit is reconciled to within 18 % of the lowest comparison which was cph . potential cost reduction opportunities on apartments are primarily linked to scope and standardisation . increased use of standardisation in construction systems and specification of components such as windows is evident in the cph , ber and utr for apartments . manufactured panel systems ( a type of modern methods of construction ( mmc ) ) are more common in cph , ber and utr than labour - intensive site- based activities ( such as block - or brick -laying ) . cph , ber and utr also deliver a higher proportion of apartments with associated efficiencies . stakeholders in stage 2 workshop noted that diversity in the design and appearance of housing can increase construction costs . diversity also makes it more challenging to increase standardisation , including materials selection . if the european approaches were adopted , it is estimated the construction cost of a two -bed apartment has the potential to be reduced by up to 14 % . this consists of 3 % savings by small reductions in specification , 6 % savings could be achieved by reducing scope ( e.g . omitting ensuite s and extent of finis hes ) and standard scope could be deferred ( e.g . kitchen , joinery and flooring ) , saving a further 5 % . 109 the scope deferral whilst still a cost would be borne by the end- user in line with their budget and timing . 10.2.3 case study ( cs ) # 4 – pbsa • ‘ travelling box ’ exercise found higher pbsa costs in european locations the ‘ travelling box ’ exercise found that overall construction costs using irish specifications on a cost -per-sqm rate for the same pbsa building are higher ( up to 11 % ) in the four european compar ator locations albeit with the costs distributed differently between the building elements . • cost ranges for actual pbsa buildings are lower in cph , ber and utr lower construction costs were evident in cph , ber and utr for actual pbsa buildings when built using the typical specifications for those locations on a cost - per-sqm rate ( 10 % to 32 % differences identified ) . • cost and design comparison found differences in scope , size and specification in cph , ber and utr on the design comparison , the study found that dub typically builds a different typology to cph , ber and utr . these european locations design and build more studio / 1- bedroom units as opposed to the 6 to 8 beds per cluster arrangement common in dub ( and b hm ) . when typical construction practices in two locations are compared , it is difficult , and not always possible to quantify cost impacts of all differences in individual regulations , standards or norms . not all standards and regulations are prescriptive . increased use of standardisation in construction systems and specification of components such as windows is evident in pbsa in cph , ber and utr . manufactured panel systems ( a type of mmc ) are more common in cph , ber and utr than labour -intensive site- based activities ( such as block - or brick - laying ) . 110 • cost modelling found potential cost reduction opportunities on scope and specification by adopting some of the findings and modelling them against the case study project , the cost-per-unit is reconciled to within 11 % of the lowest comparator location ( ber ) . the value of having a design standard for pbsa with typology options ( clusters , ensuites/ shared bathrooms , studios ) and applications ( on- campus/ off -campus ) was discussed at the stage 2 stakeholder works hop . there is currently no national design standard for pbsa . potential cost reduction opportunities for pbsa were identified as design standards and unit sizing , as well as scope and specification . 10.2.4 other findings • building services costs are higher in dub building services costs were found to be higher in dub than other locations across all dwelling types . amongst one of the main areas of difference , district heating , i.e . cph , as opposed to site- based heat generation , which is adopted in ireland . • other dwelling types required stakeholders at the stage 2 and stage 3 workshops noted the importance of considering other dwelling typologies to achieve a medium level of density , which may have potential cost reduction opportunities . • design standard for pbsa beneficial it was noted by stakeholders in the stage 2 workshop that further standardised guidance would be of benefit . national design guidance for student accommodation would inform design approaches . a range of design options for students would be preferable , incl . small studios and clustered bed- spaces , both with and without ensuites . shared rooms was also suggested as an option . • opportunity for standardisation potential benefits of increased standardisation were cited by stakeholders in the workshops . support is needed for more offsite construction systems and components , such as modern methods of construction ( mmc ) . it was noted that 111 any guidance on standardisation of plans and/or components should be accompanied by performance and economic best practice guidance . • application of planning guidance feedback noted that the variation in the application of planning design requirements for the appearance of housing can increase costs . this also makes it more challenging to increase standardisation , including materials selection . • further studies required areas for further studies which were raised included the areas of soft costs , cost impact of construction programme and cost impact of different forms of contract . 112 113 11.0 conclusion 11.1 conclusion the residential construction cost study supports both the reduction in residential construction costs and increased standardisation . this study compares construction costs between ireland and four comparator locations . it identifies potential cost reduction opportunities , which could be implemented in ireland . the study identifies opportunities for cost reduction in terms of scope , size and specification on each of the case study projects , however the value of implementing these needs to be assessed on a project -by-project basis , and considered in the context of overall development costs and market values , among other considerations , such cost displacement to residents or others , and long -term managem ent and maintenance . there are challenges to international construction cost comparisons . this is because each country / region adopts different approaches to design , construction and to reporting on construction to varying degrees . for example , construction costs in some european countries are reported based on gross external floor area , which can be 8 – 10 % larger than gross internal floor area ; whereas in ireland , conversely , costs are reported based on gross i nternal floor area . furthermore , local market conditions which refer to scale , supply and demand of goods and services , imported goods , population base , regulatory framework of the construction sector which is unique or local to a particular location all play a part in determining construction costs . challenges also confront the ‘ travelling box ’ methodology . finding a comparable scheme house and cost data in cph , ber or utr was not possible as they do not typically build semi -detached type houses . houses are more commonly delivered there on an individual basis ( with mass housing typically in higher -density housing typologies ) and in apartment buildings . this is reflected in data on the housing type mix in each comparator location where dub and bhm have a significantly higher proportion of scheme houses in the housing stock . hence , cph , utr and b er are not analysed under case study # 1 . 114 with european cost consultants unfamiliar with some details and terminology when costing the ‘ travelling box , ’ this necessitated frequent correspondence and engagement with each to explain this information . photographs and simple language were utilised to assist in such instances . this extended the overall study timeframe from what was initially allocated . also , c ertain material specifications and/or construction details are less commonplace in some locations . hence , t he consultants there based costings on what was defined as far as practicable . in limited situations where this was not possible the closest local equival ent was used . an additional challenge materialised in that european construction consultants do not typically use a boqs or similar for costing construction works . in dub , and to a lesser degree in bhm , a boqs or similar is typically adopted to facilitate the costing of construction works . this document is a detailed quantification and description of the construction works which for an apartment block can extend into many pages ( i.e . case study # 2 is approx . 90 a4 pages ) . however , cph , ber and utr , similar to the majority of european locations , tend to use less detailed documents for costing construction works . obtaining a sufficiently wide sampling of projects in cph , ber and utr to establish typical unit sizing was also more challenging than anticipated . sensitivity around releasing design information on projects was one of the main factors behind this . nonetheless , v arious data sources in each location were utilised , including a sample of designed and built schemes and discussions around same with europe an cost consultants and other design consultants based in the respective locations . fundamentally , a similar ‘ travelling -box ’ methodology could be applied to any housing typology , such as those outside the scope of this study but referenced during the work shops , as long as sufficient design and cost information were available and comparable housing typologies could be identified . this limitation can be seen in case study # 1 scheme house , where costing or local cost range data was not available in cph , ber or utr . the findings also identify a number of topics , which fell outside the scope of this study but could potentially warrant a separate study in the future . these are included in the list of recommendations below . 115 11.2 recommendations the study sets out recommendations below based on the findings , and are followed by a set of actions to be implemented following this study . general 1 . take account of the general findings in development of future policy and incentivisation measures . refer to action 1 . 2. review standardisation of housing design and construction , to include the size ranges of houses specifically . standardisation of plans and/or components should be indicative only and accompanied by performance and economic best practice guidance . this work should be coordinated with work ongoing by the housing agency on examination of innovation/efficiencies in design regarding affordable housing types , form and density , which includes a review of case examples both nationally and in other eu member states ( concluding in q2 2023 ) ; refer to actions 2 . 3. review technical specifications relating to building elements , such as external walls , windows and building services . continue to support the development of city-wide district heating in urban areas . refer to ac tions 2 and 6 . 4 . disseminate the findings of the study to ensure that the construction cost implications of decision -making at all stages in a project , including early design development and planning , are considered , taking account of observations made by st akeholders in the stage workshops . refer to action 3 . 5 . develop a design standard for pbsa , taking account of observations made by stakeholders in the stage workshops . refer to action 4 . 116 research 1 . utilise cost information from this study and other studies to analyse overall development costs . this work should be coordinated with work ongoing in related areas having regard to other studies in this area . refer to action 7 . 2 . undertake a market research study on market expectation and cultural factors e.g . whether there is a market for apartments in ireland ( for sale or rental ) without fitted kitchens and wardrobes , and/or one bathroom and no ensuite , and/or whether bare ceilings with electrical services visible would be considered acceptable to potential buyers / renters . consider undertaking a study on the technical aspects and market appetite , and raise awareness for the ‘ grey box ’ approach on apartments ( i.e . flooring , kitchens , integrated appliances , wardrobes , suspended ceilings provided by owner / tenant ) , including handover and compliance procedures . review certain standards around apartment fittings and finishes . 3 . undertake a similar cost study at regular intervals , utili sing the methodology developed in this study , including new comparator locations and housing types to expand the data available and to track trends occurring internationally . 4 . undertake a study of the cost of the social and physical infrastructure that is needed to service new development and the resulting correlation between density and cost per unit . 5 . conduct a study on design innovation and cost efficiency for medium and high density housing typologies taking account of forthcoming sustainable and compact settlement guidance by planning division on settlement forms/density standards . 6 . support research into productivity in construction study , in conjunction with a selection of construction partner and technical experts . align

of costs – ‘ travelling box ’ the following sets out the basis of irish costing and were the instructions provided to the european construction consultants to enable them to undertake the same costing of the four case study projects and ensure consistency . the costing is based on specific cities or regions rather than national averages . t he basis of the costing across the respective case studies is set out below ; • costing reflects third quarter 2022 costing levels • construction costs are representative for each reference city ( dub , bhm , cph , utr and ber ) • single stage competitive tender wit h traditional ( i.e . fully designed ) procurement ( cs # 2,3 & 4 ) • costing assumes lump sum fixed price contract ( cs # 2,3 & 4 ) • costing levels reflecting tier 1 / 2 contractor costing , except case study # 1 which is based on developer / house builder self -delivery model • preliminaries were costed based on percentage of overall value and would reflect typical percentages for both irish and local projects with in each location . percentages for prel iminaries were provided by the european cost consultant s for the ‘ travelling box ’ exercise . these were based on their internal benchmark and prevailing rates for similar projects . p ercentages vary from location to location and from case study to case study . 125 basis of costs – european benchmarking the following sets out the basis for gathering the local cost ranges data for use in the benchmarking exercise . the costing is based on specific cities or regions rather than national averages ; • costing reflects third quarter 2022 costing levels • construction costs are representative for each reference city ( dub , bhm , cph , utr and ber ) • single stage competitive tender with traditional ( i.e . fully designed ) procurement • costing assumes lump sum fixed price contract ( cs # 2,3 & 4 ) • costing levels reflecting tier 1 / 2 contractor costing , except case study # 1 which is based on developer / house builder self -delivery model • preliminaries were costed based percentage of overall value and would reflect typical percentages for local projects in each location . cost data hierarchy explained various levels of cost data were identified that are typically available and that are used for compiling and comparing construction costs . each type of data represents varying levels of detail and has a particular use in different circumstances . d ata types were ranked on a scale of ‘ low ’ to ‘ high ’ in terms of quality of data that can be used for construction cost comparisons . this created a hierarchy which informed the final methodology . b ased on the study objectives , it was agreed that the data quality needed to be in the higher categories ( i.e . boq s and labour / plant / materials ) . typical ly in dub , boqs are produced to capture the costing of construction works and are generated from drawings and specifications . adopting this level of detail for each case study optimises the layer of detail for analysis . cost benchmark data is used as a secondary source to cross -check the costed boqs , both in dub and the comparator locations . 126 table 23 :

ment is in the region of 8 -10 % where the costs are based on gross external floor area . the local consultant in each location relied upon their respective databases to generate the cost ranges . the

semi - detached houses are modelled . case study # 1 is a 123 sqm house . a 110 sqm house is also modelled . the target minimum size is 92 sqm ( qhfsc , 2007 ) . no built examples in dub of houses at 92sqm have been identified in this study . ire and uk have similar minimum spatial standard for a 3b5p semi -detached house . in the uk , actual projects which have achieved the minimum spatial standard were reviewed . for this reason , the comparison size adopted for the study is 93 sqm . net ( nfa ) and gross f loor areas ( gfa ) for a house are the same . a summary is provided in table 26 below . table 26 : 3b5p house sizing location unit size ( gfa ) dub ( case study ) 123 sqm dub ( lower range ) 110 sqm dub ( min . allowable ) 92 sqm bhm 93 sqm apartments ire and uk the national design standards in ire cite 73 sqm nfa for 2b4p . however , as identified in the scsi report ( 2021 ) , 73 sqm nfa for a 2b4p apartment is difficult to achieve whilst meeting the various design standards ( e.g . bedroom dimensions , dual aspect ) . 78.5 sqm nfa is used instead in the study . the uk has a prescribed requirement of 70 sqm nfa and actual developments achieving this unit sizing on apartments have been reviewed . over 1,300 apartments in bhm were accessed via public planning portals and reviewed . the review 135 included unit sizing as well as analysis of key design metrics ( i.e . net -to-gross ( nfa : gfa ) ratio , dual aspect , apartments per core ) . the m inimum spatial standards in ire and uk are noted in table 27 below . table 27 : ire & uk apartment spatial standards housing type ire ( nfa ) uk ( nfa ) 1b2p apartment 45 sqm 50 sqm 2b4p apartment 73 sqm 70 sqm 3b5p apartment 86 sqm 86 sqm dk , nl and ger due to the absence of prescriptive spatial standards , an analysis of a sample of actual projects in the cph , utr and ber areas was undertaken . floor plans for apartment development were gathered from a mix of sources including ; local construction professionals , local authority portals and data available on public websites . the depth of sampling from each location is summarised as follows : • cph – over 1,100 units • utr - over 490 units • ber – over 500 units from the floor plans reviewed , average unit sizing ( nfa and gfa ) are generated as well as the design metrics mentioned previously . based on the above , the unit sizing adopted for the study are noted in table 28 below . table 28 : 2b4p unit sizing location unit size ( nfa ) unit size ( gfa ) dub 78.5 sqm 91 sqm bhm 70 sqm 89 sqm cph 73 sqm 8422 sqm utr 90 sqm 110 sqm ber 89 sqm 105 sqm 22 the cph nfa/gfa are based on a 3b4p apartment as set out in the text . 136 pbsa all locations apart from the dcc local development plan , there are no national spatial standards for student accommodation in ire . from research carried out , there appear to be no equivalent student specific standards in the comparator locations . for this reason , average sqm of gfa per bedspace was generated . this is generated from reviewing and analysing actual floor plans as well as discussions with construction professionals in each comparator location . as mentioned in this study , the type of bedspace provided is diff erent in ire and uk to dk , nl and ger . the cluster style arrangement in ire and uk has a better ratio of gfa per bedspace as opposed to the studio / one bedroom apartments arrangement in cph , ber and utr . the gfas noted in table 29 below are used in this study . table 29 : area per bedspace location bedspace ( nfa ) bedspace ( gfa ) dub 24 sqm 30

performance of buildings directive ( epbd ) and applies to new buildings across all member states . for the comparator countries referenced in this study denmark and netherlands have similar overall energy performance requirements to ireland . a 2021 bpie study 23 references germany as requiring 40kwh/ sqm/ yr for new dwellings . the uk overall energy performance requirement will be similar to that for ireland from mid- 2023 . figure 29 nzeb kwh/ sqm per year values for single family homes in the eu 23 https : //www.bpie.eu/ wp-content/uploads/2021/12/bpie_assessing- nzeb -ambition- levels

composite rates from the ‘ travelling box ’ costing exercise and completed boqs received from european cost consultants , some main composite rates are noted in table 30 below to illustrate how the dub baseline costing compares to the four compar ator locatio ns . the composite rates are all -inclusive rates ( i.e . labour , plant , material ) . table 30 : selection of composite rates from case study # 2 travelling box key rates unit dub bhm cph utr ber hardcore filling to make up levels m³ €43 €40 €33 €24 €50 poured concrete m³ €172 €230 €156 €233 €239 formwork m² €49 €58 €88 €74 €79

painting to walls m² €5 €7 €28 €11 €8 highest cost lowest cost 142 in five of eleven cost categories , dub has the lowest unit cost and is the second lowest in a further three categories . dub is the highest in one category only . this would indicate that dub costs , for key components typical of various building types , are trending at the lower end of the comparator locations . labour rates data in relation to construction labour costs was gathered from european cost consultants . this aspect proved more challenging to verify due to wide and varied labour rates within the respective local markets . the eurostat index ( 2018 ) on mean hourly earnings in construction across eu member states provides an indication on relative earnings in construction . the results are indexed with ire set at index 100 for ease of comparison . both of these indexes are based on national averages and may differ from labour rates provided by european cost consultants , which are specific to the comparator locations ( e.g . bhm or cph ) . of the countries covered in this study , ire is the second lowest national average with ger the lowest ( index 87 ) and dk the highest ( index 158 ) . table 31 : mean hourly earnings in construction , 2018 the mean hourly earnings in manufacturing are set out below . of the countries covered in this study , ire ( index 100 ) is the second highest with dk the

a mix of findings applicable to all building types unless stated otherwise . only some findings were brought forward to the cost modelling stage and these are identified with comments in table 33 below . table 33 : co mmentary on specific findings and modelled items finding/ observation description modelled y/n comment specification traditional stud partition walls are not as common in cph , ber and utr . load bearing concrete / pre- cast or gypsum block are used primarily . applicable to cs # 2,3,4 y gypsum block modelled in lieu of internal non-load bearing partitions in cs # 2,3,4 composite aluminium and timber windows ( i.e . aluclad ) are seen as a premium product in some locations , i.e . upvc used in ber . in dub , aluclad is seen as a standard specification on apartment buildings . applicable to cs # 2,3,4 y upvc windows modelled in lieu of aluclad in cs # 2,3,4 external wall build -ups and detailing are notably different in cph , utr and ber . they tend to use a single leaf with insulation or a sandwich panel type system as opposed to more sophisticated external build- up with large cavities , and structural steel angles to carry masonry external leaf which is typically adopted in dub and bhm . traditional labour -intensive trades such as brickwork and blockwork are either not used , or are used minimally in cph , ber and utr . y render sandwich panel external wall system in lieu of masonry brick facades in cs # 2,3,4 145 cph adopts pre -fabrication of building comp onents more than dub . there is a cost premium in cph for labour -intensive trades typically carried out on site ( i.e . brickwork , in- situ concrete works , and formwork ) . higher labour rates , as reported by eurostat ( see appendices ) supports this finding . applicable to cs # 2,3,4 in cph , ber and utr , more standardised components are utilised , such as window types . ‘ off the shelf ’ products tend to be specified and adopted rather than bespoke component specification and sizing , which would lead to repetition and economies of scale . applicable to cs # 2,3,4 y notional value for standardisation to windows and doors in cs # 2,3,4 bathroom pods in residential buildings are more prevalent in dub than cph , ber or utr . applicable to cs # 2,3,4 n no cost reduction opportunity identified , as bathroom pods are already a cost -effective solution . building services ( i.e . plumbing and electrics ) vary across the different locations . in general , construction costs for services are a lower cost in cph , ber and utr , but there are some scope differences and this requires further examination . applicable t o cs # 2,3,4 n not possible to isolate specific costs for modelling within the scope of this study . boqs cost data based on composite rates . further assessment required . municipal level district heating serving buildings in cph and ber reduces the construc tion cost and removes the need for dedicated plant rooms . applicable to cs # 2,3,4 n not possible to cost in the scope of this study . a municipality level district heating network is considered to reduce costs for individual apartments and is being consider ed under the 146 climate action plan 2023 . exposed concrete walls with paint finish only are common in cph , ber and utr ( i.e . no lining to inner face of external walls ) applicable to cs # 2,3,4 y notional modelling . scope exposed concrete slab ( bare ceilings ) are common in cph , ber and utr ( i.e . no suspended ceilings , paint finish only ) applicable to cs # 2,3,4 y notional cost for 50 % exposed concrete slab to apartments apartments are often delivered as a ‘ grey box ’ in cph , ber and utr with the purchaser / tenant responsible for completing the fit -out ( e.g . kitchens , lighting , fitted wardrobes ) . applicable to cs # 2,3 y omission of these items modelled ensuites are not typically included in 2 or 3 bedroomed apartments in cph , ber and utr applica ble to cs # 2,3 y omission of ensuites modelled ensuites are often not included in 3 bedroomed houses in bhm applicable to cs # 1 y omission of ensuite modelled construction costs for student accommodation in cph , ber and utr , typically exclude the fixed and loose ff & e as this is normally completed separate to the main construction works . the finishes are similar to ire . applicable to cs # 4 y ff & e ( both fitted , wardrobes , kitchenettes , etc. , and loose , and fitted ) modelled unit sizing 147 123sqm & 110sqm ( dub ) vs 93sqm ( bhm ) scheme house gfa to assess the level of cost difference related to size applicable to cs # 1 y notional modelling of baseline costs ( dub ) if unit sizing in bhm was adopted 91sqm ( dub ) vs 84sqm ( cph ) apartment gfa to assess the level of cost difference related to size applicable to cs # 2,3 y notional modelling of baseline costs ( dub ) if unit sizing in cph was adopted baseline is based on 30 sqm per bedspace applicable to cs # 4 n no change modelled here as the dub unit sizing is more efficient costs based on a selection of the most common buildings components , dub composite rates ( i.e . labour and materials combined ) are at the lower end against the comparator locations . applicable to cs # 1,2,3,4 n not implementable in ireland standards/ regulations overall nzeb energy performance requirements are similar in the eu countries compared . the uk adopted a standard similar to nzeb in 2022 , however the cost ranges used in the study are based on actual projects in bhm that pre-date the adoption of nzeb . applicable to cs # 1,2,3,4 n no cost reduction opportunity identified . fire safety regulations differ in each comparator location . for example , sprinklers are generally not required in cph , ber and utr for residential buildings . applicable to cs # 1,2,3,4 n fire safety must be considered holistically and this study does not comment on a comparison of fire safety regulations . 148 149 150 www.gov.ie department of housing ,

gerard kennedy & neill killeen vol . 2022 , no . 12 rising construction costs and the residential real estate market in ireland filippo arigoni , gerard kennedy & neill killeen1 central bank of ireland october 2022 abstract construction costs are a key factor to consider when analysing the residential real estate market in ireland given their impact on housing supply . this note examines longer -term trends in construction cos ts in ireland and sho ws that these costs have increased steadily over the last twenty -five years and faster than general inflation over the same period . the increase in gross construction costs over this time was driven primarily by cost inflation in two periods , namely the early 2000s and the increases observed since march 2020 . some of these patterns have been accentuated by changes to the tax regime over the period 1998 -2008 . in the last two years , construction costs in ireland have increased substantially owing to the impact of the covid -19 shock and the war in ukraine on the costs of building and construction materials . although there are challenges with cross -country comparisons , d raw ing on a number of data sources and a rece nt bespoke questionnaire issued to stakeholders in the irish construction industry , the note shows that construction costs in ireland are at the higher end of the price spectrum in europe . the outlook for construction costs in ireland remains challenging with expectations of further increases in costs owing to a number of factors including supply chain issues as well as increases in commodity prices . 1 introduction construction costs are an important factor to examine when analysing developments in the residential real estate market in ireland given their role in determining the number of housing completions . costs associated with building a residential dwelling affect both the viability of residential construction for developers and property companies as well as the affordability of the dwelling for the end purchaser . in this note , we examine construction costs in ireland , including longer -term trends and developments that are more recent such as the impact of the covid -19 shock and the war in ukraine on building and construction materials . when examining the costs associated with the delivery of residential dwellings it is important to differentiate between two distinct categories ; namely ( i ) direct costs covering inputs to construction ( such as building materials and labour ) and 1 the views presented in this note are those of the authors alone and do not necessarily represent the official views of the central bank of ireland or the european system of central banks . email : gerard.kennedy @ centralbank.ie and neill.killeen @ centralbank.ie . we would like to thank mark cassidy , niamh hallissey , vasileios madouros and fergal mccann for helpful comments and kieran sheehan for assistance with some of the data used in the a nalysis . any remaining errors are our own . financial stability notes , central bank of ireland page 2 ( ii ) indirect costs2 ( which include land , professional fees , development contributions and levies , vat , financing and profit margin ) . as noted by kennedy and myers ( 2019 ) , based on a variety of data sources , direct construction costs can account for approximately 40 -60 per cent of the total cost of private sector residential development in ireland.3 our analysis focuses primarily on direct residential construction costs and draws on a range of data sources as well as a bespoke q uestionnaire issued to construction industry participants in ireland . moreover , the note describes how construction costs in ireland compare to costs elsewhere in europe as well as the outlook for construction costs domestically drawing on aggregate respo nses to the questionnaire . construction costs in ireland have been on an increasing trend over the last twenty -five year s. the increase in construction costs over this time was driven by two periods of elevated cost inflation in particular , the first of w hich occurred in the early 2000s , while the second has been observed more recently , since march 2020 . while housing completions and house prices fell substantially after the 2008 global financial crisis before recov ering in the post -crisis period , gross construction costs did not suffer such declines . a key factor to consider when studying construction costs in ireland over the longer -term is the impact of the expiration of tax breaks in 2008 , which had substantially reduced net construction costs in the de cade up to 2008 as described in lyons and gunnewig -monert ( 2021 ) . therefore , when considering long -run estimates of construction costs , we seek to provide an estimate of these on a gross as well as a net basis , following the approach of lyons and gunnewig -monert ( 2021 ) . more recently , and as documented in central bank of ireland ( 2022 ) and mcguinness and erskine ( 2022 ) , construction costs in ireland have increased substantially over the 2020 -2022 period following a series of shocks including the covid -19 p andemic and the war in ukraine , both of which have had an adverse impact on global supply chains . the war in ukraine has also led to significant increases in commodity and energy prices , which have exacerbated construction cost inflation in ireland . the pr ice of many key building materials , such as timber , steel and cement had risen substantially even before the outbreak of the war in ukraine in february 2022 reflecting the disruptions to supply chains arising from the covid -19 pandemic and associated publi c health restrictions internationally . 2 indirect fees may be further categorised into two groups . the first consists of the flat fees that apply on land , professional expenses ( including design , administration , sales and marketing ) and development con tributions . the second group includes percentage -based costs such as vat , financing , and risk -based developer returns , which will vary in line with other costs . 3 similarly , mcguinness and erskine ( 2022 ) note that direct construction costs such as labou r and building materials accounted for almost 50 per cent of the total delivery costs for each unit using data from the scsi from 2020 . financial stability notes , central bank of ireland page 3 the rest of the note is structured as follows . section 2 examines both the long -term and more recent developments with respect to construction costs and describes the impact of the covid - 19 shock and war in ukraine o n the price of key building materials . construction costs in ireland are placed in an international context in section 3 while section 4 discusses the outlook for construction costs drawing on the aggregate results from the aforementioned bespoke questionn aire . section 5 concludes . 2 long and short -term developments in construction costs this section provides an overview of the long -terms trends as well as the more recent evolution of construction costs , including an examination of the underlying causes and extent of price increases for some key building materials . 2.1 long -term trends - construction costs a number of data series are available t o examine how construction costs in ireland have evolved over the long -term . the first , the “ house construction cost index ” , was available from 1975 to august -2017 , and tracked construction sector labour and material costs4 on a fixed quality basis ( figure 1 ) . from these data , it is evident that the cumulative rise in gross construction costs between 1997 and the p eak of the hous ing market in 2007 ( approximately 70 per cent ) was greater than the increase in the gene ral price level as measured by the cpi over the same period ( approximately 40 per cent ) . the increase in construction costs was far outstripped , by resid ential property price growth however , which grew by approximately 250 per cent , as well as by the annual supply of residential property , which rose by approximately 170 per cent , over the same period . figure 1 also highlights divergent trends in the irish residential real estate market post the 2008 global financial crisis . while residential property prices and building activity declined substantially in the period to 2013 , gross construction costs did not decline and instead remained broadly f lat ( figure 1 ) . as mentioned above , a key factor to consider when studying the evolution of construction costs in ireland over the longer -term is the impact of the expiration of tax breaks in 2008 . as noted by lyons and gunnewig -monert ( 2021 ) , the abolitio n of various forms of the “ section 23 ” tax reliefs with respect to construction costs , which had existed from ca . 1998 to 2008 , meant the increase in actual construction costs in the period since the global financial crisis are much higher than portrayed by the official series ( figure 1 ) . conversely , following the 4 available from the department of housing , local government and heritage , the house construction cost index , relates solely to the labour and material c osts required to produce a fixed output type ( i.e . a representative 2 storey 3 bedroom la house ) . it does not include items such as overheads , profit , interest charges , land development etc . financial stability notes , central bank of ireland page 4 introduction of these schemes at the end of the 1990s , construction costs net of tax reliefs would have fallen dramatically even as gross construction costs series rose.5 a drawback of the offic ial construction costs series included in figure 1 is that it is based upon a “ fixed -quality ” basket , and so fails to account for improvements in housing quality over the period , due for instance to technological improvements or an increase in building sta ndards , which will likely lead to higher construction costs . for example , lyons ( 202 0 ) highlights how climate related policies such as the nearly zero energy building ( nzeb ) standar ds , which improve energy efficiency and benefit households over time , natu rally also add to the initial cost s of construction . 2.2 recent developments - construction costs recent quarters have witnessed a marked shift in construction costs inflation ( figure 2 ) . two additional series produced as part of the cso ’ s wholesale price index allow for a more detailed examination of recent developments in construction costs , namely ( i ) the “ building and construction ( i.e . materials and wages ) ” component of its “ wholesale price index for capital goods ” 6 5 based on media coverage from the time , lyon s and gunnewig -moner t ( 2021 ) put forward a conservative estimate that section 23 tax reliefs could have provided a discount of up to 60 per cent of construction costs during the period of their existence . 6 see cso table wpm27 . the building and construction capital goods price index is derived by combining a special hourly wage rate index for employees in the building and construction sector with the wholesale price index for building and construction materials . figure 1 : construction costs , housing supply and house prices figure 2 : annual growth in measures of

tax reliefs on construction costs over the period of their existence from 1998q3 to 2008q2 ( see dashed line ) . post 2017q2 construction cost series is rolled forward using changes in cso ’ s

its ( ii ) “ wholesale price ind ices for building and construction materials ” 7 ( wpi _b & cm ) . the latter includes detailed sub -indices for 11 separ ate categories of building materials . according to these series , there has been a substantial increase in annual construction costs in ireland over the last 18 months or so ( figure 2 ) .8 cumulatively , the wpi_ cg suggests that building costs have risen by almost 20 per cent since the beginning of 2021 , with an increase of approximately 30 per cent in the wpi_b & cm over the same period . further e vidence of the current inflationary pressures within t he construction sector are apparent from scsi data , which show that national average house rebuild ing costs9 have increased by about one fifth in the 12 months to august 2022 . the substantial increases in construction costs in ireland since the start of 2021 have been attributed to a range of factors . these include , for example , brexit induced trade frictions , supply chain disruption and deplet ed inventories arising from the covid -19 shock , as well as soaring commodity prices due to the war in ukraine . the aforementione d bespoke questionnaire issued to industry groups of the irish construction sector sought to understand the main drivers of more recent construction cost increases . when asked which factor they believed to be the most important driver of rising building costs , most respondents to the questionnaire ( 55 per cent ) indicat ed that the fallout from russia ’ s invasion of ukraine on the price of transport and energy was the key concern at present . the fallout from the covid -19 pandemic continues to be felt howeve r , with a number of participants observing the difficul ty in separating its impact from that of the war . spillovers from the war have served to negatively reinforce many of supply -side issues , which originated during the covid -19 shock including disruption s to key supply chains . many of these supply -side issues are deemed unlikely to be resolved while the confl ict in ukraine is on - going . a recent report by property consultants arcadis ( 2022 ) 10 offers an insight into how energy intensive the manufacturing process of many construction materials is and how exposed the construction sector is to fluctuations in the price of coal , electricity and gas . for instance , more than half the energy used in t he production of steel and cement is dependent on coal , while natural 7 see cso table wpm28 . the wholesale price index for building and construction materials covers home production and imports of 11 separate categories of building materials . for each commodity heading , the monthly price rela tives are derived as the simple arithmetic average of the monthly relatives for the constituent varieties surveyed . actual transaction prices are collected for materials purchased by constructi on and civil engineering firms . the price indices reflect an ‘ a verage ’ over a mixture of products from many companies throughout the country . 8 on an annual basis , the wpi_ cg was 1 1 per cent higher , while the wpi _b & cm was up by about 18 per cent , as

per square metre for different house types in differen t regions . scsi rebuild figures include the costs of demolition . one should also note that as the specifications and designs of the six house types , on which their calculations are based , have been updated for this year ’ s report , all the reported increases can not be attributed to construction inflation . 10 see arcadis “ international construction costs 2022 ” , report . financial stability notes , central bank of ireland page 6 gas is a key component in the manufacturing of bricks and roof tiles . even before the spike in energy prices due to the outbreak of the war in ukraine , arcadis had compiled data showing that energy costs accounted for up to 38 per cent of the total costs associated with some of the more energy intensive manufacturing processes , such as blast furnace steel and cement . moreover , the rise in energy costs tha t had occurred by february 2022 was responsible for 20 to 25 per cent of the increase in a range of buildi ng material costs , which had taken place around that time . these estimates therefore do not take account of the significant rise in energy prices since february 2022 , which are likely to have added further momentum to the rise in building and construction material costs . the impact of rising energy costs and other supply -side shocks have contributed to significant increase s in the wholesale prices of many key building materials ( figur e 3 ) . notwithstanding the recent moderation , timber products have experienced the largest annual price increase s in recent months ( 70 per cent in jan 2022 ) , with steel also recording a notable inflationary surge ( over 40 per cent in august 2022 ) . outside of these products , the wholesale prices of cement , concrete , and stone , sand and gravel are also currently growing at a rate greater than 10 per cent per annum . prolonged increases in construction and buil ding material costs will have an adverse impact on the viability of many residen tial dwelling schemes ( for a given level of house prices ) , where direct construction costs already account for just under 50 per cent of the total cost of delivery .11 moreover , at a time when the supply of new housing is already constrained , an increase in development costs raises the risk of exacerbat ing the challenge over the medium -term ( 2 to 5

decisions given increasing costs . indeed , recent data indicat e a decline in the number of annual residential commencement notices from approximately 35,000 in march 2022 to 30,000 as of june 2022 . similarly , in its lat est quarterly bulletin ( october 2022 ) the central bank of ireland forecast housing completions of 27,000 units in 2023 before rising to 30,000 in 2024 . this represents a reduction of approximately 8,000 units over the forecast horizon compared to its openi ng quarterly bulletin of 2022 ( january ) . this in part reflects the limited availability of materials and labour but also higher constructions costs . 3 irish construction costs in an international context this section place s recent movements in domestic construction costs in an international context . in the analysis that follows we explore how direct constructions costs have evolved across european countries in recent years and examine where ireland ranks relative to peer cou ntries in terms of the scale of construction costs inflation and the expense of building materials used in the delivery of residential housing . it is important to note that there are challenges when comparing construction costs internationally in a consis tent manner due to difficulties posed by exchange rate movements , divergences in building standards and regulations , and differences in the level of efficiency and productivity across countries . while some international data on gross direct construction co sts have been collected for a number of years , much less information pertaining to indirect costs exists . this makes it difficult to carry out an in -depth analysis or compar ison of d evelopment s in non -labour or material building costs , which are likely to vary significantly across jurisdictions . though data availability is les s of an impediment with respect to the comparison of direct construction costs , challenges remain , including how best to assess overall affordability levels within and across markets ( for instance in monetary terms ) . despite these data issues , the analysis that follows draws on a myriad of data sources to show that construction costs in ireland are generally at the higher end of the price spectrum in europe . figure 4 presents a comparison of growth rates from eurostat ’ s output price index for construction of new residential buildings12 acros s the eu 27 , and shows how developments in ireland have closely tracked broader european trends over the past couple of years . after a relatively stable 2020 , with muted construction activity across the continent due to the impact of covid related public health restrictions , inflation in the construction sector rose rapidly in many 12 also known as the producer price index , this series provides a measure of what building contractors pay for the input factors in residential construction , and includes materials , labour , plant and equipment , transport , energy , productivity , profit margin and other related costs . for more information , see ; construction producer price and construction cost indices overview , eurostat . financial stability notes , central bank of ireland page 8 countries throughout 2021 , with romania , bulgaria , estonia , hungary and slovenia all recording increases of more than 15 per cent . the latest data for 2022q1 places ireland close to the european median in terms of the extent of construction inflation since early 2020 , before the onset of covid -19 . meanwhile according to data compiled by construction consultancy firm linesight ( 202 1 ) 13 , ireland ranks close to the top when it comes to the extent of tender price growth rates across seven european countries , over a slightly longer period ( 2014 to 2021 ) . as lyons ( 2018 ) observes however , one shortcoming of this type of analysis is that the data are expressed in index form , i.e . 100 at a certain point , with movements in costs over time and across countries given relative to this . as a result , it is challenging to get a sense of the overall affo rdability within and across markets ( for instance in monetary terms ) . turner and townsend ( 2022 ) produce cross -country construction cost data , as part of an international construction market survey , which also includ es a global ranking of the average cost to build across 88 city markets for both residential and commercial buildings . to calculate the most expensive location to build , the authors of the report convert all costs to us $ 14 and compare 13 linesight ’ s tender price index is an average view of changes in tender prices across different locations , project types and sizes . according to their “ europe 2021 ” report , ireland ’ s tender price index was over 50 per cent higher in 2021 than in 2014 , compared to equivalent figures of 34 per cent for sweden , 32 per cent for denmark , 31 per cent for the uk , 25 per cent for germany , 23 per cent for the netherlands and 11 per cent in france . for more information see ; linesight “ europe 2021 ” . 14 according to the turner and townsend methodology , building costs per m² , include the direct costs associated with the construction of a building ; including preliminaries ( or gen eral conditions ) costs a nd substructure , columns , upper fl oors , st aircases , roo f , external walls , external doors , internal walls , internal doors , wall finishes , floor finishes , ceiling finishes , fitments , plumbing , hvac , fire protection , electrical and communication syst ems and transportation systems . it is assumed that building cost s are based on the typical building standards and building methods for the region . as all costs are converted into usd , exchange rates will have an impact on each market ’ s ranking based on the strength of currency against the us dollar . for more informatio n see ; turner and townsend “ international construction market survey 2022 ” .

expensive place in the world to build in 2022 ( $ 4,729 per m2 ) . data from its most recent release for 2022 show dublin rank s 15th highest in terms of construction costs out of 88 global cities . narrowing the focus to european cities ( including those located in the uk and switzerland ) , shows dublin ranks 4th of 23 , behind geneva , zurich and london ( figure 5 ) . a similar exercise by arcadis ( 2022 ) 15 which co mpiled data for 100 locations for its annual “ international construction cost ” report placed dublin 12th in terms of the costs of construction associated with 20 building types ranging across the residential , commercial , industrial and social sectors . restrict ing the analysis further , and concentrat ing on the construction costs associated with residential property schemes only ( as measured by turner and townsend ) , dublin ranks the 3rd most expensive location to build apartments and the 2nd most expensive place to build townhouses , out of the nine european cities for which these data are available ( figure 6 ) . indeed , as shown in figure 6 , construction costs for the build of townhouses and apartments in ireland are slightly above the average of all nine cit ies included . while construction costs in dublin are broadl y similar to those in uk cities , they rank higher than those in mainland europe an locations such as munich , amsterdam and paris . in addition to these data , turner and townsend ( 2022 ) publish cost details of eleven common building materials as well as wage rates for six categories of construction workers in a number of the locations they monitor . according to the 2022 figures , dublin ranks as the most expensive of nine european cities for material such as copper pipe and paint , the second most expensive for timber and copper cable , and the third dearest location to source plasterboard and bricks . in contrast , it is the least expensive of the nine cities for concrete , b locks and steel products . ( figure 7 ) . in terms of labour costs , dublin ’ s highest ranking ( 2nd of 9 ) relates to individuals engaged in insulation and heat pump instal lation . in contrast , w age rates in dublin appear to rank comparatively lower than many of the other european locations covered , and for carpenters and bricklayers ( 9th ) , plumbers and electricians ( 8th ) and carpet layers , tilers and plasterers ( 8th ) in particular . 15 the arcadis methodology is based on a survey of construction cost s , a review of market conditions and the professional judgement from its global team of experts . ranges of indicative prices for each building function are collected for each city . low and high range costs are converted into us dollars ( usd ) , normalized an d indexed against the price range for each building type for amsterdam , where amsterdam = 100 . for more information see ; arcadis “ international co nstruction costs 2022 ” report . financial stability notes , central bank of ireland page 10 our research on how the level of direct construction costs in ireland compares to elsewhere was supplemented by the inclusion of a question on this topic in the bespoke questionnaire circulated to construction industry groups . participants were asked how t hey would characterise the cost of construction and building materials in ireland compared to elsewhere in europe . the results are depicted in figure 8 . in total , 86 per cent ( six of the seven respondents to this question ) believed building materials were higher in ireland compared to elsewhere in europe while none were of the opinion that they were lower . taken together with some of the cross -country data sources on construction costs such as the turner and townsend ( 2022 ) and arcadis ( 2022 ) reports described above , this suggests that construction costs in ireland are , in general , at the higher end of the price spectrum in europe . 4 outlook for construction costs this section details the aggregate results from the bespoke questionnaire issued to construction industry group s as part of this analysis.16 one of the key issues considered in the questionnaire was the outlook for construction costs . first , participants were asked how they expect annual construction and building mat erial costs to evolve over both the ( i ) short ( 1 year ) and ( ii ) medium ( 2 to 5 years ) term . a summary of the responses received is presented in figure 9 . over the short -term , some slowdown in the pace of 16 the questionnaire was distributed amongst eight residential construction sector stakeholders , including industry representative bodies ( with combined membership of over 7,600 firms and individuals ) and market experts during september 2022 . in total eight completed surveys were returned from five organisations , with multiple responses from one organisation . see annex for details of the questions included in the survey . figure 7 : cost of selected building materials across european cities 2022 figure 8 : costs of construction and building materials in ireland compared to elsewhere in europe index ( dublin costs =100 ) index ( dublin costs =100 ) per cent per cent source : t urner and townsend and authors ’ calculations . note : chart is based on d ata from london , dublin , manchester , birmingham , glasgow , leeds , munich , amsterdam and paris . source : central bank of ireland and authors ’ calculations . note : aggregate responses to survey question : broadly speaking , how would you characterise the costs of construction and building materials in ireland compared to elsewhere in europe ?

bank of england summary of business conditions the bank of england published its most recent update to the agents ’ summary of business conditions on 22 s eptember 2022 , covering intelligence gathered between mid-july and late august 2022 . key points : •construction output growth weakened as high materials costs , labour shortages and ec onomic uncertainty weighed on activity . •contacts in residential construction said that planning delays and concerns about risi ng bui ld costs had slowed the pace of new projects starting . growth in domestic hom e i mprovements and maintenance had also eased . in social housing , new constructi on had been he ld back by budget constraints and commitments to refurbish existing properties . •by contrast , commercial construction activity remained strong , in particular for offic e dev elopments in prime locations . demand for warehouse and data centre premises also remained robust , but demand for retail and leisure premises weakened

2022 . key points : •the mean gdp forecast for 2022 is 4.1 % up from 3.4 % in the previous month ’ s survey . •the mean gdp growth forecast for 2023 is -0.3 % , unchanged from the previous month ’ s survey . the office for budget responsibility published a new economic and fiscal outlook on 23rd march 2022 . •gdp is expected to grow by 3.8 % in 2022 ( down from 6 .0 % in the previous forecast ) and by 1.8 % in 2023 ( down from 2.1 % in the previous forecast ) .monthly statistics of building materials and components – october 2022 15 construction output forecasts experian published their s ummer 2022 forecasts f or the construction sector in july 2022 . key points : •total construction output in 2021 reached £169.6 billion ( 2019 prices ) , a close t o 13 % i ncrease on the previous year , regaining most of the ground lost during the worst of t he pand emic . the industry started 2022 well , with output up 8 % in real terms in the first two m onths compared with the same period of 2021 . growth will slow , but the prognosis is one of expansion over the forecast period , averaging 3.7 % a year . this would take output t o £189 . 4 billion in 2024 , over 7 % above its pre-pandemic level in 2019 . •total construction output rose by nearly 13 % in 2021 , recovering most , but not all , of t he gr ound lost during the height of the pandemic in 2020 . expansion has continued into t he f irst four months of this year , with output reaching £59.37bn ( 2019 prices , seasonally adjusted ) , 6.5 % up on the corresponding period of 2021 . the only sectors not to experienc e gr owth over this period are the public non-residential and private commercial ones . expansion is expected to slow somewhat during the remainder of the year but growth for total construction output is still projected to come in at over 5 % in 2022 . •despite anaemic gdp forecasts for 2023 and 2024 , construction output is predicted to grow at a reasonable rate , of 3.3 % in the former year and 2.7 % in the latter one . the only sectornot forecast to see expansion over the two-year period is the public housing one . t he pr ojections for the whole of the forecast period are similar to those made in the spring , but lower than the winter forecasts , due to unforeseen external factors , such as the conflict i n u kraine . •growth in new work is forecast at 6.1 % in 2022 and 3.2 % in 2023 , down from 11.3 % growt h i n 2021 . the housing sector is forecast to grow by 3.3 % in 2022 and 1.9 % the followi ng y ear . growth in the non-residential building sector is forecast to be 9.6 % in 2022 and 5 . 3 % i n 2023 . •repair and maintenance ( r & m ) is forecast to grow by 3.7 in 2022 and 3.5 % in 2023 , dow n f rom 15.7 % last year . the construction products association published their construction industry forecasts fo r summer 2022 in july 2022 . •construction output is forecast to rise by 2.5 % in 2022 and 1.6 % in 2023 . according to t he l atest cpa construction forecasts as strong growth in warehouses and infrastructure offsets , a slowdown in private housing and a fall in private housing repair , maintenance a nd i mprovement ( rm & i ) from historic high levels . •the industrial sector , which covers activity on warehouses and factories , is forecast t o be t he fastest growing sector in the next two years . output is forecast to rise by 15.0 % in 202 2 and 9 . 8 % in 2023 , as activity continues to be boosted by the strength of online retailing as well as manufacturers ’ need for increased stocks given the persistence of supply chai n i ssues over the last two years . •infrastructure , the second largest construction sector , will also be a key driver of growth wit h out put expected to rise by 8.5 % this year and 3.8 % in 2023 . long-term pipelines of work i n r egulated sectors such as roads , rail , water and electricity will drive growth . this is boost ed f urther by major projects such as hs2 , thames tideway tunnel , and hinkley point c despite ongoing delays and cost overruns . however , medium -term , local infrastructure i s l ikely to suffer from councils being financially constrained . central government projects willmonthly statistics of building materials and components – october 2022 16 also be affected as there will be no further finance beyond november 2021 ’ s spending review . this is despite an ambitious infrastructure pipeline and strong cost inflation . •private housing remains cautiously optimistic as annual house price growth continues atdouble-digit rates and major house builders continue to stress the strength of the market.however , with the uk economy expected to contract in 2022 q4 , there remains uncertaintyregarding how long housing can remain buoyant . the cpa anticipates that uk annualhouse price inflation will slow to 6.0 % later this year and 2.5 % in 2023 - as lower housi ng dem and is partially offset by a lower supply of homes on to the market unless unemployment rises significantly and increases the number of forced sellers onto t he ma rket , suppressing house prices . near -term concerns for major house builders focus on m ortgage availability after the end of help to buy in march 2023 . other key issues for houses include planning and rising costs of materials , labour and meeting the new buildin g r egulations . private housing output is forecast to rise by 1.0 % in 2022 and remain flat i n 2023 . however , if house price inflation continues to surprise on the optimistic si de and dem and is enabled by high mortgage availability , risks may be skewed towards the positive . •private housing rm & i - the third largest construction sector - has been a key driver of activit y ov er the last two years due to the ‘ race for space. ’ output is currently 20 % higher than pre- pandemic but firms report that smaller , discretionary spending on improvements activity isalready falling away , albeit , from a historically high level . private housing rm & i is the sector most exposed to changes in consumer confidence and real incomes . it is also the sector that is most exposed to materials and products cost inflation , as small contractors are lessable to plan and purchase in advance for projects . overall , output is expected to fall by3.0 % this year and a further 4.0 % next year . however , given that activity in the sectorreached historic highs in early 2022 , the sector has the potential for falling even harder t han f orecast . this is dependent on the extent to which falling consumer confidence translates into households ’ reduced investment in their own homes and the risks are to the downside . manufacturing the latest index of production data for august 2022 were published on 1 2 october 2022 by the office for national statistics . k ey points for the sic 23.1- 4/7-9 industry ( includes the manufacture of bricks , tiles and other construction products ) : •when comparing august 2022 with august

materials and components – october 2022 18 technical information 1 . the office of national statistics ( ons ) replaced the following price indices for construction materials from the november 2020 release of this publication ( published on 4th december 2020 ) onwards ; sand & gravel excluding/including levy , crushed rock excluding/including levy , and bituminous materials . this affects tables 1 , 2 and 3 in the bulletin and table 1 in the commentary . further information is provided in the footnotes of each table . a back series of both the previous and replacement indices was published alongside the november 2020 release of this publication . 2 . in work done for the department for business , innovation and skills ( bis ) on improving the quality of statistics published in the monthly statistics of building materials and components , the office for national statistics ’ methodology advisory service ( mas ) recommended that bis should start seasonally adjusting key data series ( see ons/mas review of building materials statistics : final report f or more detail ) . seasonal adjustment is widely used in official statistics and aids data interpretation by removing effects associated with the time of the year or arrangement of the calendar . seasonal effects often obscure features of interest in data , such as long- term trends and effects of unusual occurrences . by removing seasonal effects , users can more readily identify the features of interest . following advice from the mas , and the results of a consultation ( s ee the results of the bis consultation on seasonal adjustment f or more detail ) , bis agreed to publish seasonally adjusted data for the following series : sand and gravel , total sales concrete blocks , all types deliveries bricks , all types deliveries ready -mixed concrete , deliveries for initial publication of seasonally adjusted data , data from 1983 onwards w as seasonally adjusted . subsequently , for each monthly publication , data up to 12 months or 4 quarters prior to the new data point is revised . upon the completion of each year ’ s data series , data for the previous 12 years is revised . beis publish es both non- seasonally adjusted and seasonally adjusted data in the tables of this publication . from the june 2015 edition this publication has used seasonally adjusted data in the commentary for these series . the most recent annual review of seasonal adjustment was carried out in august 2022 . 3 . quality issues related to the building materials and components outputs are discussed in the review of the building material statistics that was carried out in 2010 by bis ’ s construction team . the review aimed to ascertain user needs , examine whether existing data collection methodologies are fit for purpose , estimate compliance costs , assess compliance with the code of practice and identify options for change . the full report can be found on the beis building materials and components webpage . detailed information on data suppliers , coverage and data collection methodology can be found in sections 2.1 -2.10 . quality issues ( coverage and accuracy of sample panels , response rates , survey results processing , disclosure etc . ) and potential measures that could be employed to improve the quality of the statistics are discussed in section 2.11 of the monthly statistics of building materials and components – october 2022 19 review . users ’ views on the quality of the building materials and components statistics are given in section 3.3.4 . these are derived from a user survey carried out in early 2010 , as part of the review ( see section 3 for details ) . 4 . following the review , bis acted on the recommendations including commissioning the office for national statistics methodology advisory service ( ons/mas ) to address some of the recommendations from the 2010 review . in july 2011 , mas published their interim report . in july 2012 , mas published their final report . 5 . hm revenue and customs use administrative sources to produce overseas trade statistics . a statement of administrative sources used to compile construction material trade statistics is available on the beis bu ilding materials and components webpage . separately , hm revenue and customs also have a statement of administrative sources which covers overseas trade statistics . 6 . the pre- announcement of any major changes to sa mples or methodology also details some methodological changes to the collection of data . 7 . the following table gives a summary of response rates related to some of the latest survey results . where the response rate is less than 100 % , estimates are made for missing values . for latest data used bulletin table number response rate quarterly sand and

assessment against the code of practic e for statistics in 2011 . monthly statistics of building materials and components – october 2022 22 since the latest review by the office for statistics regulation , we have continued to comply with the code of practice for statistics , and have made the following improvements : • carried out a public consultation and introduced publication of seasonally adjusted data on deliveries of sand and gravel , concrete blocks , bricks , and ready -mixed concrete • in response to the cessation of dluhc ’ s ( department for levelling up , housing and communities , formerly mhclg ) annual minerals raised inquiry , which previously supplied the sampling frame for the land- won sand and gravel survey , we h ave : o changed the survey from sample survey to a census , increasing the panel from 200 sites to around 500 sites o refreshed the panel of sites annually using information from the british geological survey o made the survey statutory under the statistics of trade act 1947 , bringing it into line with the marine- dredged sand and gravel survey • improved the design of the blocks survey , making it fully monthly instead of a mixture of monthly and quarterly data collection • introduced the publication of the tables in an opendocument ( ods ) spreadsheet , in addition to microsoft excel • rebased all price indices series to 2015 =

expect further growth in the eu construction sector this year and next , despite a continuing shortage of some building materials . the eu construction confidence indicator was positive at the start of 2022 . building volumes should be boosted by fresh investment from the eu recovery fund new homes being constructed in stellendam in the netherlands content further increasing material shortages- higher sales ' prices- eu construction confidence indicator positive- issuance of residential building permits stable- europe at a glance- low growth infrastructure sector- huge differences in the long run- more growth expected for eu construction sector- further increasing material shortages the outlook for construction in the european union has changed . back in september last year , we noted in our eu construction outlook that supply chain economic and financial analysis 9 february 2022 articledisruptions , due to the covid-crisis , were decreasing the supply of building materials . this was just as construction output bounced back after the first wave of the virus . this resulted in shortages and price hikes . in august , a record percentage ( 18 % ) of eu contractors indicated lower production due to a lack of building materials or at least a delay in their delivery . this percentage shot up ( 29 % ) in january 2022 , with the highest shortages in france and germany . highest shortage of building materials in france and germany % eu construction firms that have to limit production because of material & /or equipment shortages , january 2022 source : european commission , ing research new french regulations cause material shortages in france , most contractors are faced with high material shortages compared to other main european countries . as french construction volumes haven ’ t fully reached pré-corona levels yet , strong demand isn ’ t the whole narrative . france has recently implemented a new law requiring half of the materials used in public buildings to be timber or other bio-based materials . this leads to increasing demand for these specific materials and shortages , especially as timber is still scarce . supply chain disruptions in other countries shortages are also high in germany , austria and the netherlands as production levels , and therefore demand for inputs are , and have remained high , in these countries . we expect that building material shortages will continue for a while , not least because of china 's 'zero-covid ' strategy and restrictions put in place to contain the virus in cities and ports that are very important to global production chains . however , there are very few construction firms that mention a shortage of building materials in belgium , spain and turkey . higher sales ' prices supply chain disruptions and higher energy prices lead to higher building material prices . this puts pressure on profit margins and building companies are therefore passing through price hikes to their sales prices . this results in a record number of building companies that are planning to increase their prices at the beginning of 2022 . on balance , 36 % of eu building firms plan to increase prices in january 2022 . this is the highest percentage for the last 20 years . german , austrian and dutch construction firms , in particular , expect to raise their sales price . these are the same countries that face material shortages due to high demand as we discussed above . highest % of contractors that plans to increase sale price balance of construction companies in eu that expect to increase/decrease output prices ( over next 3 months ) source : european commission , ing research eu construction confidence indicator positive despite price pressure , business confidence at the beginning of 2022 is positive among most contractors in the european union and back to pre-covid levels . the highest values are registered in austria and the netherlands . optimism among contractors in both countries was already high before the covid-19 outbreak and recovered quickly after the first wave . furthermore , construction volumes in these countries were barely hit during the lockdowns as construction sites remained largely open . spanish construction sentiment has been hovering around neutral in the last few months though order books are improving . in turkey , construction sentiment in january withered away , probably due to high inflationary pressure at the moment . optimism among most contractors construction confidence indicator , seasonally adjusted source : eurostat , ing research issuance of residential building permits stable the issuance of residential permits is a strong indicator for future production . huge housing shortages in many european cities ensure sufficient demand in the residential sector . the number of approved new home permits in the eu has been stable in the first three quarters of 2021 . it has been hovering around the pre- corona level since the end 2019 . we , therefore , don ’ t expect high growth figures in the eu residential building sector in the coming year . however , there are huge differences between countries . eu permits for new homes remains flat building permits , number of new dwellings , ( index 2019 q4 =100 , sa ) source : eurostat , ing research europe at a glance france and spain back to pre-corona levels spain has made up for the decrease it faced during the first corona wave . in the third quarter of 2021 , it has even issued slightly more building permits than at the end of 2019 . spanish new residential output can profit from this in 2022 . french permit-issuing has made a comparable move , although recovery started a bit earlier . residential markets in spain and france are also being boosted by the renovation market . france ’ s maprimerenov scheme offers generous grants ( circa 30 % of renovation costs ) , and interest-free loans to help households to finance the job . in spain , the recovery plan includes €6.8 billion for incentive measures for housing renovation , plus another €1.0 billion for public rental housing . stable permit numbers in belgium , germany and austria residential permit issuance in belgium , germany and austria has mainly been moving sideways in the last few quarters . all three countries , like many other european countries , have a strong demand for new houses but shortages of building land , high prices and time-consuming permit procedures constrain further growth . for austria , the graph shows that the number of austrian permits was still below the level seen at the end of 2019 . however , this is due to a peak in austria 's permit issuance in the last quarter of 2019 . correction of issued permits in the netherlands in the netherlands , the number of permits issued for new homes couldn ’ t maintain its growth in the third quarter of 2021 and fell back in the third quarter of 2021 . to solve the low supply of houses , the new dutch government proposes building 100,000 new houses per year . this is very ambitious , as 1989 was the last year this figure was reached and the current yearly number of completions is approximately 70,000 . nitrogen emissions are still an issue , but there are several new measures to keep construction on track . the central government has agreed to speed up decision-making processes for large housing projects and there are funds reserved to reduce the deposition of nitrogen in nature areas to compensate for construction emissions . issuing of turkish building permits flat after volatile period turkey 's issuance of new housing permits has been volatile in 2020 and in the first half of 2021 . in the third quarter of 2021 , it remained stable at a relatively higher level . however , this is far below that of 2017 before the turkish exchange rate crisis which resulted in a big rise in construction costs and consequently a sharp drop in building activity in 2019 . in addition , the next risk for turkey is the primary concern at the moment of high inflation caused , in part , by the devaluation of the lira . low growth infrastructure sector the eu infrastructure sector has shown moderate growth ( +1.5 % yoy ) in november 2021 . this after almost no growth ( +0.2 % yoy ) in the same period a year earlier . however , there are large differences between countries . the infrastructure sector in spain for example showed a sharp decline as many construction sites were closed during the first lockdown and the sector wasn ’ t yet in a good shape from the aftermath of the financial crisis . however , spanish infrastructure companies are at the beginning of 2022 positive about their future building activities , as spain will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of eu recovery and resilience funds . growing infrastructure sectors in austria , turkey and germany development volume civil engineering ( infrastructure sector ) , index 2011=100 * source : eurostat , eecfa , cbs & ing research * period jan-nov sa and turkey & the netherlands 2020 data huge differences in the long run in the whole european union , production levels in the infrastructure sector have been quite stable for the last 10 years . however , it dipped a bit during the aftermath of the financial crisis when central governments were cutting budgets but caught up after that . the infrastructure volumes in belgium , the netherlands and france are also around the same level as 10 years ago . in germany , investment in rail and roads increased by more than 30 % in the last decade . that is needed because german infrastructure is in a patchy state . for instance , the tallbrücke rahmede viaduct , which is part of an important highway through the ruhr area , is neglected in such a way that it ’ s impossible to renovate and has to be torn down and rebuilt . despite the high growth rate , the infrastructure sector is still relatively small in germany compared to many other european countries.2.5 % eu construction output in 2022 forecast ( volume % yoy ) relatively large infrastructure sector in turkey and small in germany production infrastructure sector in 2020 as a % of gdp and total construction output source : euroconstruct , eurostat , eecfa , ing research more growth expected for eu construction sector in general , our eu construction outlook remains optimistic . despite the shortages of building materials and structural shortages of labour , we expect further growth in the eu construction sector in 2022 and 2023 . building volumes can be boosted by new investments from the eu recovery fund . ongoing housing shortages and high house prices provide structural demand for new residential construction . furthermore , non-residential construction will see a rebound as the covid-crisis fades , and entrepreneurs are less reluctant to invest in new company premises or renovate their existing properties . the construction sector in germany has been quite resilient during the covid crisis . it was the only country that did not witness a decrease in construction volumes in 2020 . however , construction output development was almost flat in 2021 . bad weather at the beginning of 2021 and pull-forward effects due to the termination of a vat reduction at the end of 2020 hampered growth last year . in addition , german contractors are among the most constrained by labour and material shortages at the moment . nevertheless , we expect that german construction will resume growing . the growth of permit-issuing for residential building is moderate , order books are at their highest peak this century and supply chain disturbances will probably diminish in 2022.eu construction forecast : growing construction volumes volume output ( value added ) construction sector , % yoy source : eurostat , ing research * forecasts for spain , we forecast a recovery of construction volumes this year and next but it won ’ t make up for the large drop from the last two years . yet spanish building backlogs are better filled and spanish construction confidence was almost neutral in january 2022 . furthermore , building permit issuance is on the rise but output will still suffer a bit from the lower levels during the last two years . the spanish construction sector will see positive effects from investments of the eu recovery funds . the netherlands witnessed minor growth in 2021 in construction output . building restrictions due to excessive nitrogen emissions have limited production , especially in the infrastructure sector . we expect slightly stronger growth in 2022 and 2023 . as several government measures are being introduced and the newly installed government intends to create a fund for “ national programme '' in rural areas . this fund is mostly aimed at reducing nitrogen emissions ( including buyouts for farmers near protected nature areas , cumulatively the size of 3.1 % annual gdp ) which also could give some space for new building projects . even though building permits dipped a bit in the third quarter 2021 , the dutch confidence indicator is still at a high level and order books are well filled . we expect that construction production growth will continue this and next year . we see further recovery in france and belgium this and next year . the construction sector in both countries was severely hit by the pandemic in 2020 , therefore the high growth rates in 2021 reflect a rebound from low levels . furthermore , french construction output still won ’ t reach its pre-covid level this year . for turkey , expectations are uncertain due to the effects of current high inflation in the country . in november 2021 , turkish construction turnover soared by more than 50 % ( yoy ) mainly due to high inflation . volume growth was consequently a lot lower . demand for new construction is hindered by these high prices and we , therefore , diminished our growth expectations compared to our september forecast . still , there will be some low growth left for this year and next but output maurice van sante senior economist construction & team lead sectors maurice.van.sante @ ing.comvolumes

inflation2 international construction costs 2022 construction , however , has again proved itself extremely adaptable during the last year in responding to the difficult circumstances . we have seen sustained delivery of housing and infrastructure across most global markets , better use of data , and increasing investment in technological solutions such as modern methods of construction , all of which can improve efficiencies and aid the drive to net-zero . this adaptability will prove vital as businesses ready themselves for the uncertain and inflationary environment ahead . this theme is central to our 2022 international construction costs index , which highlights dramatic price fluctuations in many regions around the globe . while there is healthy confidence in the future of the construction sector internationally , differing government covid-19 strategies have resulted in varying paces of recovery . meanwhile labor and skills shortages have caused supply and demand challenges in many areas , such as europe . these shortages have been felt across the supply chain , forcing businesses to tackle pressing and persistent problems such as low productivity , staff retention and project resilience . our five-point plan later in this report provides a pragmatic guide to dealing with the unique challenges of 2022.sustainability is equally high on the agenda . construction and operation of built assets is responsible for 38 % of global greenhouse gas emissions , according to the un environment and international energy agency ’ s 2019 global status report . cop26 also emphasized the growing need to transition away from fossil fuels , as our recent 2021 supercharging net zero report details . in the face of ongoing material shortages , efficiency and productivity remain a must . in this respect , the need for efficient design is likely to drive further investment in innovative solutions , while a big push from many governments , both in terms of financial support and the implementation of legislation , has crystalized long-term sustainability commitments . while on the surface the looming market conditions sound unfavorable , we believe these challenges more than ever present our industry with a great opportunity to drive forward innovation . in order to reduce our impact on the environment and our reliance on resources , we need to adopt a mentality of doing more with less.this report will give you the insight you need to navigate the current and future challenges ahead . it will show how flexible , pragmatic decision-making can allow businesses to adapt to fluctuating and unpredictable conditions and put themselves in a market-leading position to take advantage of a period of growth . foreword the road to recovery from covid-19 has been a rocky one . strained logistics networks , surging demand for critical global commodities , waning stockpiles , and global inflationary pressures all hit during 2021 . the conflict in ukraine is set to exacerbate material and hydrocarbon shortages , with significant repercussions for global commodity and energy markets . andrew beard global head of cost & commercial management 3 pathway to recovery a look back at 2021 the roll-out of covid-19 vaccines in many countries paved the way for a second wave of economic resurgence in early 2021 . from the second quarter onwards , and after a series of successive lockdowns , a synchronized global recovery started to gain momentum . this wave of opportunity has had significant implications for many construction markets covered by our international construction costs index . first and foremost , in response to the snap-back of the global economy , the supply side has struggled to build capacity . this is due to a combination of factors , ranging from a shortage of personnel to pressures in the logistics market . combined with a strong recovery in commodity prices , all these factors have created unusually inflationary conditions.global gdp growth reached 6 % in 2021 , according to the international monetary fund ( imf ) , and is expected to reach 4.4 % in 2022 . much of this is bounce-back from dismal levels of output in 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 . in parallel , consumer price index ( cpi ) indicators across the world rallied , with both developed and emerging economies recording annual price increases well above 5 % . despite hopes that inflation might be temporary , central banks indicate that price increases are here to stay , reversing the expansionary policy stance adopted in response to the pandemic . so far , this has not stifled the markets and construction is booming in many locations despite the headwinds.the arcadis international construction costs index 2022 international construction costs 20224 international construction costs 2022 who is top of the index and what are the major changes ? in 2021 construction costs increased significantly in most locations , with inflation reaching levels not seen in recent years . as this was the case across the world , the cost increases are not immediately obvious from the ranking . many cities remain clustered together like last year . the top 10 remain largely the same , though geneva and london swapped the two top positions , and oslo took third place . due to a combination of cost drivers and high sector-specific demand , markets in north america and in many european cities recorded double-digit cost increases . as a result , american cities moved up significantly in the ranking . this upward trend was also helped by the us dollar appreciating on average by 5 % against most currencies . cities in the uk and germany also move up the index.across asia , the picture has been mixed , with costs largely remaining stable . one exception is singapore , where difficulties in accessing labor triggered high levels of inflation . in australia and the middle east , on the other hand , demand levels did not quite meet expectations , leading to a more competitive market and a more significant part of costs being absorbed by the supply chain . this has resulted in locations such as melbourne or sydney dropping as much as 10 places in the ranking in 2022.cost analysis : where is the inflation coming from ? construction markets were among the first to be impacted by increasing prices . in fact , throughout 2021 we faced two waves of inflation . the first wave arrived in the second quarter of 2021 , driven by an increase in commodity prices – copper recorded a 70 % increase ; aluminum was up by almost 40 % compared to pre- pandemic levels ; and iron ore more than doubled in price , sending the cost of steel to a historic high . but from a price inflation perspective , the top spot was taken by timber . due to a boom in the us housing sector , along with rampant demand from the home improvement market , this more than tripled in price . by the fourth quarter , demand for these commodities eased slightly and iron ore dropped by 50 % . however , as the cost of energy started spiraling , materials that are energy intensive to produce – such as cement , glass or tiling - began to increase in price by 10-15 % . timber seems to be joining the second wave of price inflation too , driven by lower harvests in the us and canada . steel also remains expensive . while inflation driven by the price of construction materials is apparent , we have yet to see the potential impact of labor costs . as a result of the pandemic , in many markets there have been shifts in labor availability , with some migrant workers returning home , some moving countries , and some quitting the sector to either retire or requalify . 5 international construction costs 2022while data on the exact numbers of workers is scarce , and pay trends can be difficult to follow , there is plenty of anecdotal evidence of workforce shortages in our market commentaries . this is something to watch , and a potential cost driver likely to keep inflation at elevated levels in 2022 . despite these challenges , construction markets across the world are booming – but the impact of inflation is different for different sectors . the residential sector , which is sensitive to timber pricing , has mostly been able to pass on the additional costs in a flourishing real estate market . similarly , so has the private industrial sector . despite exposure to the elevated cost of materials like steel , in many locations private industry has delivered record output . the commercial sector ‘ s performance has varied , with overall work delivery rates falling well below pre-covid levels . the office market , however , has been recovering steadily – albeit with a bigger contribution from refurbishment projects . going forward , sectors capable of passing costs down the supply chain are likely to continue delivering . the ones with restricted resources may need to consider rationalizing their scope of work . ultimately , whilst inflation will eventually slow , it may take time to eliminate . 6 international construction costs 2022london geneva oslo new york city

costs 2022deep dive : the role of energy in the construction materials supply the manufacturing of many materials used in construction is highly energy intensive . for materials such as steel or cement , more than half of the energy used comes from coal – either metallurgical or thermal . natural gas is mainly used in the production of bricks and roof tiles . such high exposure to coal , gas and electricity makes the construction materials sector particularly vulnerable to prolonged energy price increases . in figure 1 we illustrate how the recent price increases impact costs for some of the most energy-intensive materials . the data was compiled before energy prices spiked in response to the ukraine invasion . the chart shows that energy costs account for up to 38 % of the total costs associated with some energy-intensive manufacturing , such as blast furnace steel and cement . with the energy mix for different processes increasing by around 20-25 % , clearly the impact of further increases in energy costs will be significant . this prompts the question – how long will energy costs continue to escalate ? even before the latest crisis , there was no simple answer . the international monetary fund ( imf ) had forecast natural gas prices to stabilize by the end of the second quarter of 2022 at a level 50 % higher than the start of 2019 . however , since the invasion of ukraine , wholesale energy prices have stayed above the high prices seen in january and february 2022 . given the uncertainty , no one is attempting to forecast energy prices at the moment . however , what is clear is that construction , with its exposure to energy-intensive materials , will be one of the industries that pays the price . looking back at 2021 , various global data sources point to an average increase in 2021 of 25 % for the price of a basket of construction materials . in addition , prices of new categories of materials - including cement , bricks , glass and plasterboard , which so far did not record elevated levels of inflation - are accelerating . this indicates that clients and the construction supply chain will have to endure another year of price uncertainty . the extent to which manufacturers of construction materials are exposed to fluctuations in the price of coal , electricity and gas isn ’ t going away . looking further ahead , the global transition to cleaner energy may result in higher costs of gas and electricity , as more generators move away from coal power . however , as the share of renewable electricity grows , prices should stabilize eventually and fall . figure1 : the contribution of energy costs to construction materials prices and impact of recent energy price increase ( quantiﬁed in % increase on product price ) 0 5

2022secrets of success in an inflationary market the current worldwide pressures on construction , manufacturing and resources , are due in part to covid-19 . market stability has not been helped by seismic shocks to the global economy caused by recent geopolitical tensions . this has created an ongoing inflationary environment that has caused a set of new challenges for clients to grapple with : • an uncertain and volatile market • increased risk due to difficulties in predicting cost • pressures felt throughout the supply chain • an increasingly complex and challenging climate change agenda that will need to balance energy and resource security alongside rapid progress toward paris agreement goals • the conflict in ukraine causing huge market shifts and resource restrictionsthese problems are sizeable and complex . in addition , a looming viability challenge , caused by the likely cooling of an asset boom across sectors such as housing , commercial and logistics following covid-19 , could exacerbate the situation further . with little room left to maneuver , boosting productivity is key . global labor productivity averaged just 1 % over the last two decades , according to the mckinsey global institute . if values are to grow , organizations will need to make some rapid changes to protect and maximize their returns . a focus on managing the cost drivers , as well as proactive risk management and maximizing organization-specific value must take center stage . 9 international construction costs 2022setting up for success globally , all these issues contribute to a shifting and uncertain future . to successfully navigate the turbulent waters ahead , business should consider the following practices . in this climate , it is vital that businesses are open-minded and inquisitive so as to fully understand their supply chain strength . though insolvencies have been limited over the last two years , it is likely they will become more common . we are already starting to see this filter through , with australia ’ s major a $ 1.4bn contractor , probuild , collapsing in february 2022 . in an inflationary market , organizations must be laser-focused and work hard to manage costs , remove waste , and renew efforts to increase productivity . a thorough interrogation of the supply chain can reveal a string of innovative capabilities that may have previously gone unnoticed , particularly regarding sustainability agendas . here , under- utilized solutions , such as modern methods of construction , could help reduce material waste , as well as time and labor input . alongside this , businesses will need to adopt a pragmatic mentality . as our country-specific deep dive later in this report highlights , flexibility around timescales will be key as access to resources – human as well as material – may increasingly dictate program timescales . australia , for example , is forecasting a severe shortage of construction workers . vacancies in the country have already increased by 80 % since late 2019 . singapore and germany are also expecting workforce pressure to intensify , with german contractors claiming 50 % of open positions for skilled labor can ’ t be filled . at the same time , the sector must be agile and quick in its ability to respond to changing supply chain circumstances , particularly in relation to pricing , where suppliers may only be able to hold prices for a short window of time . to make projects more equitable , economic and certain , sharing risk will be critical . in some cases , this means all parties must be willing to recognize that predicting and managing cost risk from certain materials can be difficult given supply chain challenges . some clients may benefit by sharing cost risk to avoid upfront costly premiums , but the construction supply chain also needs to recognize that clients need outcome certainty , and to hit certain cost points to deliver successful results . 10 international construction costs 2022doing more with less with limited resources , it is vital organizations find more efficient means to deliver their plans . for example , looking at technological solutions that reduce labor levels while opting for sustainable materials to lessen environmental impact . these changes aren ’ t always cheap , so it is important that clients consider the value of the full project lifecycle , rather than the cost of short-term returns . the current materials-led inflation cycle is already biting across many markets , with countries like germany experiencing inflation because of reduced access to steel and timber . combining the economic pressure of resource scarcity with sustainability goals stresses the importance of doing more with less . this places a fresh challenge on clients to view their approach to project delivery through a different lens – and front and center is the robust assessment of whether a project ’ s whole-life cost weighs up to its true benefits . it is becoming ever more imperative that the sector re-evaluates how it defines value . short-term gain around capital cost reduction , for example , could end up costing more in the long-term , so a more sophisticated assessment of value could better deliver a project fit for the future . this will consider both capital and operational costs , as well as current and predicted consumer trends that might require a long-term investment in adaptability so that an asset can be put to different uses.while there will always be short-term issues that need to be resolved , companies that keep an eye fixed on the longer term will be well positioned to navigate future challenges . the sustainability agenda is central to this approach and requires all companies to start thinking outside the box , particularly as world governments begin to introduce tougher sustainability measures in their pursuit to reach net-zero by 2050 . carbon pricing , for example – effectively a tax on non-sustainable materials – will increasingly factor into client decision-making in the medium- to long-term . the price of carbon in europe peaked at €97/ton in february before the ukraine crisis , 100 % above levels seen in spring 2021 , and adding €200 to the cost of a ton of steel . in addition to incentivizing investment in low- carbon manufacturing , higher carbon costs could also prompt a positive shift in design thinking . clients might , for example , be challenged to rethink their design , such as opting for retrofit or material reuse rather than demolition or the sourcing of new , scarce materials . an example of this smart design in action can be seen across cit group ’ s uk-based hylo scheme – a £140m commercial project in london delivered by arcadis , contractor mace , and structural engineer aktii . the team used an innovative design to retain a large proportion of an existing main tower structure whilst increasing overall floor space with a new vertical extension . 11 international construction costs 2022by keeping significant amounts of the superstructure framing , basement and foundations , hundreds of tons of concrete and steel were retained and far less new material was used . this resulted in a quicker program involving fewer deliveries and onsite hours , lower costs and less impact on the local community . another critical factor underpinning the sector ’ s resource scarcity and sustainability agenda is for companies to make better use of available digital products and solutions . by harnessing the power of data to develop a deeper understanding of their buildings , buildings can become more energy and cost-efficient . collecting and applying building data can have multiple benefits when it comes to sustainability goals and efficiency . in the uk , arcadis has joined forces with a technology partner , demand logic , to deliver 30-day digital audits of buildings to analyze trend profiles of a building ’ s performance and energy waste , and to develop a comparative benchmark analysis . the data analysis finds operational inefficiencies and suggests quick- win solutions to save on running costs and lower carbon emissions by tweaking the building ’ s systems . for example , by analyzing trends we can see when power is being used out of hours , on floors that are not occupied , or where heating and ventilation are not being used effectively . ultimately , the opportunities to adapt to new market conditions are there and can produce significant competitive advantage if deployed effectively . by getting ahead of future trends as well as utilizing information and products that are already on the market , there is a real chance to drive change and create more value from less . this can come from an asset perspective , but also regarding social and sustainability benefits , leading to a greener , more efficient and considerate industry . if organizations aim to successfully navigate the pressures felt across global markets , then they must be open-minded and adaptable in the face of challenges ahead . this will not only deliver benefits to their organization and supply chain but ensure that our buildings and infrastructure are fit for future generations . mjøstårnet , norway12 international construction costs 2022a practical guide to navigating today ’ s market volatility why you need this guide global markets are currently experiencing unprecedented levels of uncertainty and volatility . the aftermath of covid-19 has caused serious inflationary pressures that are being felt throughout the supply chain , making it harder than ever to predict cost and project timelines . this , of course , creates a much riskier environment that clients must navigate and with one eye on the future – including delivering critical sustainability targets and finding a route around any potential consequences the ukrainian crisis will bring.this guide has been designed against this backdrop : a tool to help assess how well positioned clients are to tackle the immediate challenges ahead . below are a series of touchpoints and checks that clients can use to discover how prepared they are to successfully deliver their project in today ’ s climate . 01 0502 0403supply chain resilience leadership and management planproject resilience team cultureproject optimizationa practical guide to navigating today ’ s market volatility international construction costs 202213 international construction costs 2022 • direct sanction impact – companies may need to review links with suppliers if sanctions are extended , meaning alternative sourcing plans need to be put in place . • financial health – covid-19 after-effects could be exacerbated by the ukraine crisis , meaning companies should have sufficient reserves and should test the financial strength of their supply chain , including assessing their wider contracts . • transparency – companies must ensure their supply chain meets updated supply chain expectations regarding ownership , funding , and materials sourcing.• single point of failure – companies must identify supply chain risks that might delay or disrupt a program , such as semi-conductor availability , supplier failure or critical contractors , for example m & e specialists or mmc pod manufacturers . • contract resilience – businesses should consider to what extent supplier cost risks are locked down to protect both themselves and their suppliers . • procurement resilience – companies should consider using a shell and core/fit- out procurement strategy to reduce longer-term risks associated with cost/program , as well as early design lockdown on certain elements.• team optimization – companies can ’ t afford to carry waste and must maintain a sharp focus on cost by keeping things as lean and efficient as possible , for example by minimizing role duplication . • design optimization – companies should adopt a ‘ less is more ’ approach to materials . a sharp focus on design economics and circular economy principles will reduce costs and support longer-term sustainability objectives . • design fixity , quality , and maturity – businesses must ensure their design concept is sufficiently worked through to enable their supply chain to build as intended and to ensure changes are kept to a minimum . • behaviors – companies should implement an active problem- solving culture and be prepared to handle uncertainties . collaboration , aligned objectives , and transparency are key . • practical measures – businesses need to ensure prompt payment , fast decision making to mitigate risk , and accurate , efficient record keeping . • workforce – companies must foster a supportive working environment to attract and retain talent . scarcity of labor and skills shortages put more pressure on existing teams , while concerns around energy costs , inflation and mental fatigue all add additional strain . • leadership matters – recent global crises have demonstrated the difference that excellent , consistent and inspiring leadership can make . • scenario planning – companies should work with their project team to plan for a more complex business environment , focusing on aspects such as materials , people , covid-19 , and business failure . • crisis response plan – with rapidly changing geopolitical conditions , companies should ensure this is constantly updated to react to the latest circumstances . 03 05 04project optimization leadership and management planteam culture 01 02supply chain resilienceproject resilience international construction costs 202214 international construction costs 2022 “ construction has largely recovered from the pandemic , but that recovery is coming with an inflationary cost . skills shortages will only get worse , and this will become the challenge of the decade . businesses that invest in the industry ’ s transformation will find themselves in a market-leading position in an industry that underpins the australian economy. ” matthew mackey , australia construction around the world a deep dive into a select group of markets which have shown noteworthy changes and initiatives during the last year . 15 international construction costs 2022 asia - pacific australia in australia , the post-covid economic recovery is ongoing , and has been delayed by one of the world ’ s toughest lockdown regimes . it is clear that the management of the pandemic by australian authorities has resulted in a relatively brisk bounce back . however , delayed growth has translated into a slower than expected recovery in the construction sector . over the past year , a weak work pipeline has resulted in a very competitive projects market , with little inflation being passed to clients . workload is now returning , driven by the commercial , industrial and residential markets , with a particular focus on data centers and institutional rented housing . while public investment works are not yet in full swing and are a work in progress , planned infrastructure investments are likely to put even more strain on resources translating to further inflationary pressure . in the future , a severe shortage of construction workers will present a huge challenge to the industry . construction vacancies have increased by 80 % since late 2019 , and by 2023 there will be over 100,000 unfilled roles in construction . this will be almost 50 % greater than the number of people who are expected to be qualified to fulfil them . as confidence returns to the construction sector , it urgently needs to focus on becoming a more resilient industry investing in digital , modern methods of construction and practical measures to improve sustainability.hong kong hong kong saw relatively low levels of price inflation during 2021 . the construction sector cooled in the first half of 2021 . due to the pandemic , both consents and commencement of domestic and non-domestic work in the first half of 2021 dropped substantially compared with the second half of 2000 . with the resumption of a normal approvals process , the outlook for new orders has been improving . but the prospects for both ongoing and new projects is still challenging , with the former experiencing delays due to limited access to materials imported from mainland china , and the latter still exposed to elevated materials prices . covid-19 continues to create challenges . at the time of writing , hong kong is still subject to covid restrictions , and the supply of materials has sometimes been disrupted when mainland cities have entered lockdown . contractors have also had to absorb substantial materials cost inflation during 2021 . going forward , the public sector is going to be the main growth driver , with the value of approved funding in the past two years having increased by around 40 % . with potential constraints to the availability of migrant labor , there is a strong drive to adopt modern methods of construction across all industry sectors . planning processes have been adapted to accommodate the design for manufacturing approach . there is also a strong incentive for contractors to introduce innovative proposals , as they will be awarded higher quality scores as part of the tendering process . “ looking ahead to 2022 , we can be cautiously optimistic about the level of construction activity in both the private and public sectors . this is because of positive signs in 2021 , which include a growing number of consents in the private sector , increased funding for public works , and the government ’ s priority for increased public and private housing supply. ” francis au , hong kong 16 international construction costs 2022 singapore singapore bounced back strongly during 2021 . total construction demand grew by 42 % , following a decline of nearly 40 % in 2020 . recovery during 2020 had been held back by the industry ’ s covid-safe restart criteria and difficulties associated with bringing foreign labor into singapore during the pandemic . during 2020 , steps were taken to protect the construction sector with the covid-19 ( temporary measures ) act , which required clients and their supply chains to share costs and other contractual risks . this has left the construction supply chain in good shape to deal with a rapid recovery , but it did not prevent a significant wave of construction inflation during 2021 . the outlook for 2022 looks promising with a strong pipeline worth between s $ 27bn and s $ 32bn ; similar to 2021 . the public sector will be a key client during the recovery , providing 60 % of total construction demand , mainly through public housing and large infrastructure investments , such as the cross island line ( phase 1 ) and sengkang punggol light rapid transit ( lrt ) depot expansion . to ensure successful delivery , singapore needs to tackle a serious labor shortage , which has been amplified by restrictions on foreign workers since 2020 . projects are already affected through slower programs and higher costs . new measures are being introduced to incentivize the recruitment of foreign workers with higher skill levels . from 2024 , contractors will only be able to recruit five foreign workers for each local employee . a new employment levy structure framework will also encourage more offsite work . “ there has been a long-term aim to increase the productivity of industry in singapore . new measures to encourage contractors to employ high-skilled workers and increase the use of modern methods of construction are a welcome step , but in the short-term , labor pressures are expected to intensify. ” josephine lee , singapore 17 international construction costs 2022 mainland china the chinese construction market was worth over $ 1.1tn in 2021 . growth continued throughout the pandemic due to the decisive management of outbreaks as they emerged . continuing growth has been supported by investment in infrastructure in small and medium sized cities . the commercial sector also did well with particularly high levels of investment from the tech sector in many cities , along with some retail and grade a office development . the residential sector had a more difficult year . there is a genuine need for new housing , but the market slowed as authorities took action to stabilize some heavily indebted developers . new measures , including smaller deposits and lower mortgage rates , should stimulate demand . chinese construction markets were exposed to moderate inflation of around 5 % during 2021 . as a result of the pandemic , the labor resources in first- tier cities were in a slight shortage , and price rises were driven mostly by soaring material costs . there were occasional disruptions to projects caused by covid-19 related lockdowns , albeit these affected isolated cities rather than the entire market . 2021 saw the launch of the 14th five-year plan . major initiatives in the plan with implications for construction markets include a major push for carbon neutrality , a target to increase common prosperity by having 65 % of the population living in cities by 2025 , and a commitment to the protection of biodiversity in pursuit of building an ‘ ecological civilization ’ . “ having declared that it will ensure that carbon emissions reach their peak no later than 2030 and that the country will achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 , the construction of green buildings is critical for china . on top of this , at the end of 2021 , the chinese government announced that real estate will remain a critically important industry , which has contributed to projected stability in the country ’ s construction market in 2022. ” joe chan , mainland china 18 international construction costs 2022 europe united kingdom uk construction completed its recovery from covid-19 by late 2021 , but had changed shape significantly , with dynamic growth in both large-scale infrastructure and small-scale domestic home improvements . the uk ’ s infrastructure investments are spearheaded by the hinkley point nuclear power station and high speed 2 , where spend will really start to accelerate from 2022 onwards . the uk ’ s building contracting sector has seen mixed fortunes . the logistics and industrial sub-sectors are booming despite long lead times for critical steel products , whereas commercial and public sector building development is slow , helping to keep construction markets competitive . “ the uk government promised to ‘ build back better ’ at the height of the pandemic and current high levels of investment in design and procurement for rail , highways , hospitals and schools promise a bright future for the construction sector . private investors are also demonstrating confidence in the future of cities , with a wave of projects aimed at the low-carbon market. ” peter hogg , uk inflation has been a big challenge for clients across the industry , although small-scale construction has been most exposed to extreme fluctuations in material prices . house-builders have been cushioned from inflation by long-term materials purchase agreements , and house price inflation and many commercial projects have been protected by fixed-price contracts . inflation accelerated rapidly in the second half of 2021 , and contractors that had not fixed their prices with their suppliers have come under significant price pressure . inflation on competitively tendered projects is around 5-6 % , but total inflation is much higher , and some increased cost is being absorbed by the supply chain . markets have been buoyant during 2021 and contractors have a much healthier pipeline of work than they did 12 months ago . this has reduced competitive pressure a little , although project teams are still focused on making sure that projects are viable as well as profitable . 2022 and 2023 should see public sector programs associated with mobility , health and education accelerate , adding further to an already busy sector . these long-term programs will give project teams much needed certainty on which they can focus investments in innovation and low-carbon processes and materials . 19 international construction costs 2022 belgium the belgian construction market was booming throughout 2021 and according to eurostat data , output grew by 7 % . however , recovery came at a cost , and limited access to construction materials , including steel and timber , has caused many delays . while these materials are now more readily available , prices are still high . in the aftermath of problems during 2021 , many projects are now focusing on program recovery and minimizing any further overruns . on existing projects , contractors are exposed to increased costs that exceed the value of contractually defined inflation adjustments . for new projects , inflationary pressures and increased risk premiums affect viability . eurostat forecasts that over the next couple of years , growth in belgian construction markets will slow , with 2 % growth in 2022 , and 1 % in 2023 . moderate growth will take away some pressure from price inflation but will not eliminate all input cost pressures associated with labor and materials . in particular , mega projects including the €3.35bn oosterweel ring road project in antwerp will create even more competition for resources over its 10- year duration . part of belgium ’ s €5.9bn covid recovery will be spent on low-carbon renovation , low-carbon energy and enhancing natural habitats . “ belgium ’ s last major infrastructure construction boom took place in the 1970s . today , latest initiatives to improve belgium ’ s cities and networks will need to integrate sustainable thinking focused on minimizing the use of materials . this will keep costs and environmental impacts under control. ” ann van melkebeek , belgium 20 international construction costs 2022 france 2021 saw a strong recovery from europe ’ s deepest covid-19 economic contraction . construction output fell by 65 % at the peak of france ’ s lockdown , but recovered during 2021 . output is forecast to grow by 3 % in 2022 , after bouncing back by 12 % the year prior . yet the recovery has not been without its challenges , including a mismatch between supply and demand and europe-wide problems associated with accessing skills and materials . circumstances improved towards the end of 2021 , with activity increasing at the fastest rate since summer 2020 . in response to very challenging markets , public sector clients took the unusual step during 2021 of providing contractual relief on a case-by-case basis with respect to delay penalties and some cost increases . projects like 2024 paris olympics took specific measures to control and secure schedules and costs by anticipating much more strategic supply needs such as steel and wood . france has a series of long-term investment programs aimed at becoming more sustainable , resilient and better prepared for the challenges and opportunities arising from the emerging green and digital agendas . these include the big investment plan worth €57bn , which will complete in 2022 , and france ’ s €39bn share of the european recovery fund , which will support programs including the decarbonization of existing building stock and investments in the modernization of the railway and will further support the development of green hydrogen . “ the recovery was strong in 2021 , particularly in paris , driven by national growth of nearly 8 % , a recovery plan largely dedicated to the construction and transport sector , as well as a resilient real estate sector , which is back to almost 2019 levels . however , the outlook for 2022 is still relatively uncertain , given the global geopolitical situation and pressures on the supply chain. ” nicolas boffi , france 21 international construction costs 2022 germany germany ’ s construction sector grew during 2020 . such a striking performance at the height of the pandemic means there was little bounce back in 2021 , and growth was at around 2 % . however , germany has little spare capacity and local markets were exposed to some of the highest levels of inflation in the icc survey . contractors claim that 50 % of open positions for skilled labor can ’ t be filled , and continuing lockdowns during 2021 have further disrupted access to migrant labor . with new orders in december 2021 increasing by 12 % compared to the previous year , prospects are good – but will be difficult to deliver . the residential market is the most important segment of the german construction market . the recently elected new government is seeking to prioritize the development of housing , including 100,000 affordable homes . whilst housing development has been brisk in recent years , developments in connection with subsidies might slow markets down . for example , the beg ( low-energy housing program ) fund has been closed to new applications in january 2022 . another positive development for the sector is the further acceleration of the government ’ s long-term €270 bn program aimed at the renewal of germany ’ s long-neglected transport infrastructure . major investments in berlin and hamburg include the i2030 program extending eight rail connections in berlin and the replacement of the iconic kohlbrand bridge in hamburg . the “ traffic light ” coalition is committed to investment in public works , so further opportunities should emerge. “ supply shortages of building materials are forcing a rethink in materials management . instead of demolition , clients are analyzing whether their existing assets can be reused . if this is not possible , then we are seeing a much wider application of circular economy principles , looking at how many materials can be reused. ” birgit detig , germany 22 international construction costs 2022 the netherlands the dutch construction sector worked throughout the pandemic and has continued to perform well . current workload is high , at around €120bn . this has been supported in part by a u-turn on measures to control nitrogen pollution , which had delayed a significant amount of development in 2019 and 2020 and caused many delivery challenges . in addition to pressures around construction materials , labor shortages have been a major problem , caused by travel restrictions on migrant workers and covid isolation rules . labor shortages have become such a limiting factor that abm amro claim that 20 % of construction firms have turned down projects . interestingly , the netherlands has not applied for eu covid recovery funding – possibly because the economy is running well enough without the added stimulus.as described , the market is booming across diverse sub-sectors , and is expected to grow by 5 % in 2022 . residential work especially is in high demand , driven by a combination of factors , including the need to increase existing housing stock by another 1 million homes by 2030 , ensuring it is well connected to public infrastructure improvements , and the need to retrofit in line with net zero requirements . sustainability and net-zero are at the top of the agenda across all building typologies , with the netherlands being a pioneer in the implementation of sustainable solutions and the circular economy at a large scale . “ as dutch cities recover from the pandemic , there is greater interest in the quality of green and blue infrastructure and how this contributes to providing attractive and healthy public space . alongside the decarbonization agenda , public authorities are also giving more attention to the upkeep of aging assets , including the ‘ bridges and quay walls ’ program in amsterdam. ” verali von meijenfeldt , the netherlands 23 international construction costs 2022 “ while every local market has its own individual challenges , worker shortages and supply-chain issues are plaguing construction projects across the country . though some developers plan to limit production rates , creative , sustainable building strategies are critical for the us to address increasingly dire housing shortages and rapidly increasing costs. ” leann tomas-foster , north america north america united states the us construction market is worth $ 1.5 trillion , but so far , the recovery from covid-19 has been mixed . covid- related restrictions caused uncertainty during 2021 , which was reflected in a decline in workload across the commercial sector . at the same time , the infrastructure bill was delayed . despite this , infrastructure workloads remained steady , supported by state- and city-level recovery initiatives such as the 6-year $ 45bn reinvest illinois capital plan . in contrast , the us house-building sector had its busiest year since the financial crisis , with over 1.7 million residential permits being issued ; up 25 % compared to 2019 . even though overall growth in construction activity was modest , the us experienced some of the highest levels of inflation recorded in the icc survey . almost every project was exposed to these problems , requiring extreme measures including early design freezes and accelerated procurement . such solutions were only suitable for clients capable of managing the altered risks that follow a forced program acceleration . prospects for 2022 look better . covid restrictions are being lifted , investor confidence is returning , and material prices are declining . some decisions on infrastructure investment are also expected to be made ahead of the mid-term elections . supply chain and labor risks are still significant , but overall , project teams are proceeding with plans to mitigate these risks with cautious confidence . 24 international construction costs 2022methodology arcadis developed its comparative cost index for 100 cities , covering 20 building functions , based on a survey of construction costs , review of market conditions and the professional judgement from its global team of experts . ranges of indicative prices for each building function are collected for each city . low and high range costs are converted into us dollars ( usd ) , normalized and indexed against the price range for each building type for amsterdam , where amsterdam = 100 . average low and high index ranges are calculated for each city based on the 20 building types . the data was collected in the first quarter of 2022 . analysis was undertaken prior to the conflict in ukraine , and the potential impacts of the invasion on the construction markets are not included . costs used to calculate the index are based on buildings delivered to local specification standards , meeting both functional requirements and quality expectations . as a result , the index compares the relative costs of delivering the same building functions in a city , it also reflects the different levels of quality expectation reflected in a specification . the index does not take into account purchasing power parity . the construction cost data used in the index is current as of 1st quarter 2022 . the exchange rates used to calculate the index were current on 9th february 2022 . disclaimer this report is based on market perceptions and research carried out by arcadis , a design and consultancy organization for natural
